1,Love Fantasy: Match & Stories,4.8,"202,602",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 1, 2022",Zero stars if I could. This app is horrible. I get notifications every 5-10 minutes. And the coins for the tasks are way to high. Sometimes I have to do more than one game. And it's literally the same exact thing as candy crush. Deleting immediately.
2,Love Fantasy: Match & Stories,4.8,"202,602",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 22, 2021","Starts out okay and then things progress to the point where you HAVE to watch ads in order to pass a level. Annoying. Plus, you have to pay for everything you do, like ""brush hair"" and ""dry hair"" and ""style hair"". Money grab is right."
3,Love Fantasy: Match & Stories,4.8,"202,602",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 26, 2021","At first I thought this was going to be a different experience, but it isn't. My problem is when you get to the 2nd character, the amounts for makeup, services and clothes jumps astronomically. Just insane. So, you spend almost all of your time with the puzzles. There needs to be a balance."
4,Love Fantasy: Match & Stories,4.8,"202,602",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 2, 2022",It was fun at first but then for some reason I can't play the game anymore. I open up the game and just freezes. Now it's stuck on the intro and ask me if I either wait for close the app. And seems that none of us are getting replies of how to fix this problem so I'm uninstalling it
5,Love Fantasy: Match & Stories,4.8,"202,602",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 29, 2021","Terrible! You spend all your time viewing adds because the point level is so high for each little thing you're required to do to move forward. 700 points to make reservations at a nice restaurant... really. I thought I would like this, but no way how it is designed."
6,Love Fantasy: Match & Stories,4.8,"202,602",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 2, 2022",I had 5 stars when it was going fine until it stopped a week ago. This game did not respond to me. I can click on anything on the page and it does not respond. The company has not respond to my message or attempt to help fix the problem.
7,Love Fantasy: Match & Stories,4.8,"202,602",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 30, 2021","This game is really fun. The only reason that I give this game four stars is because the tasks cost too much coins. To take off previous clothes is like 500 coins. I don't like that about this game. Aside from that, the game is really fun and a great way to pass time."
8,Love Fantasy: Match & Stories,4.8,"202,602",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 22, 2021","👎👎 It was a decent little game. However, the amount of ads made it tedious and boring. I deleted this game within a week of starting it due to the amount of ads. They must get paid per ad as they don't ask for in game purchases often."
9,Love Fantasy: Match & Stories,4.8,"202,602",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 26, 2021",I understand ads. Please understand that they surpass a point of diminishing returns. Was fun at first but crossed that line shortly. As I uninstall this I won't be generating anymore revenue. Think: less is more
10,Love Fantasy: Match & Stories,4.8,"202,602",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 24, 2021","I'm at level 133. The game froze and it never worked again. If it's not fixed in a week or so, there's no reason to keep it. Update: well, I had hope the updated version would fix the problem. NOPE."
11,Love Fantasy: Match & Stories,4.8,"202,602",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 16, 2021","It's a fun game, very addicting. But the only issue I have is that everytime I watch an ad, the whole game freezes for me. And sometimes, even freezes my phone. Other than that, I would recommend the game."
12,Love Fantasy: Match & Stories,4.8,"202,602",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 25, 2021",The game was fun at first until it keeped making me spend almost all my money on the outfits and when I would run out of money I would have to play a stupid game not to mention the adds I don't recommend cus after one play I never wanted to play again
13,Love Fantasy: Match & Stories,4.8,"202,602",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 4, 2022",Language in the script is not something I would allow my teenagers to play.

14,Love Fantasy: Match & Stories,4.8,"202,602",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 24, 2021","The start was okay, after going through the story and levels it got difficult. It costed at least 400, 600 for each when you barely earn enough for the puzzle. Not enjoyable, spent more time on ADs and not on the story."
15,Love Fantasy: Match & Stories,4.8,"202,602",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 30, 2021","Was cool till I had to pay to remove make up, wash face and other ish like that. Also notice makeup doesn't really show. The game part is fun but everything else needs work. No one wants to pay to wash face, come on now."
16,Love Fantasy: Match & Stories,4.8,"202,602",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 2, 2022",Fun but to simple and it really don't let u choose your own path except what they give you. It only gives one option to choose from at the end of characters having a conversation sometimes 2 options.

18,TRIVIA STAR Quiz Games Offline,4.8,"199,602",Top Free,Trivia,"January 4, 2022","Could be fun. But as stated in 99% of the reviews the ads are not worth it.

20,TRIVIA STAR Quiz Games Offline,4.8,"199,602",Top Free,Trivia,"December 31, 2021","It's a nice challenge. Test what you know.

21,TRIVIA STAR Quiz Games Offline,4.8,"199,602",Top Free,Trivia,"January 3, 2022","Winning an average of 100 coins, which is the cost to play a round of trivia, isn't enough at all when it costs 500 to upgrade your good experts. I lost 3k in coins very fast and days later I am no where near back to where I was. This is a very fun trivia game otherwise."
22,TRIVIA STAR Quiz Games Offline,4.8,"199,602",Top Free,Trivia,"January 2, 2022","Good... Please fix the freezing ads.

53,Wordscapes Search,4.8,"139,596",Top Free,Word,"January 5, 2022",There are too many ads that are impossible to get out of and back to the game. I like the game but get stuck in an ad that will not take me back to the game. Will be uninstalling this game.
54,Wordscapes Search,4.8,"139,596",Top Free,Word,"December 12, 2021",I never pay to remove ads from apps but I did for this one. The ads were a tad excessive and I wanted the gameplay without any interruptions. This is a very calming game that is perfect for killing some time.

71,Solitaire,4.8,"154,587",Top Free,Card,"January 3, 2022",1. The full screen ads are difficult to escape from when you are allowed to. 2. The spam notifications to play today can only be disabled by removing the Android permission for notifications.

79,Solitaire,4.8,"154,587",Top Free,Card,"December 31, 2021",Every time a add finishes the screen goes black and I have to exit out of the game inorder to start a new one. It's getting annoying. Would be 5 🌟 if this didn't happen.

91,Solitaire,4.8,"154,587",Top Free,Card,"January 6, 2022","Fun, the games strategy continues to grow harden, but slowly enough I learn the skills needed."
92,Solitaire,4.8,"154,587",Top Free,Card,"December 21, 2021",I enjoy the game although it does seem repetitive at times. I like the challenge of the journey but its frustrating when you get so far and the games start cutting off before times up or saying you haven't completed a level even though you're still playing. This needs fixed.

Once I hit $48 it started only rewarding 10 or 20 cents for monetary rewards and those are few and far between. This is clearly designed to have you invest time in watching ads to no gain on players part. My advice....steer clear of this app!!

Yet, even after you finish everything, you are placed in a fake queue to receive your robux which takes MONTHS to complete. Which I tested. Then, when you get to spot 1, it's never filled. You cannot receive robux from this game."

501,Cut Grass,4.4,"53,134",Top Free,Casual,"January 3, 2022","Okay. So the game is advertised as free robux, and which is true, but if you got this game for that delete it. The ads need to be cut down by a long shot because if you want it to be peaceful, the ads get in the way about weird stuff."
502,Cut Grass,4.4,"53,134",Top Free,Casual,"January 5, 2022",Its a good game but it gets to the point where I was giting 0.001 gem per game and so many adds at least one add per level and then after you get 10000 gems you have to watch 50 adds and then when you get past that you have to play 24 hours or watch 24 adds for it to start getting through
503,Cut Grass,4.4,"53,134",Top Free,Casual,"January 5, 2022",This game is fake! I downloaded this game as a test and it's fake. One has ads after every round. Every time you get closer to the goal it gives you less and less gems.
504,Cut Grass,4.4,"53,134",Top Free,Casual,"January 5, 2022",It's a good game fun and entertaining as i've seen in other reviews it does give you like 30 gems after awhile lots ads but you can mostly skip them I have not won any robux yet because I don't have enough gems if it does not give me robuxm I would give this a 1 star
505,Cut Grass,4.4,"53,134",Top Free,Casual,"December 29, 2021",From the rating I have heard I think I might just delete it. The ads need to be cut down and it's takes forever to get like the 10000 gems. I don't recommend it unless you just wanna play the game like to cut the grass.
506,Cut Grass,4.4,"53,134",Top Free,Casual,"December 27, 2021",This game sucks! It starts off making you think it will be easy and giving you like 160 gems but as time goes by it goes under 1 like 0.6 then down to even 0.08 and so on. It takes hours and I never get robux. I suggest you don't even waste your time
507,Cut Grass,4.4,"53,134",Top Free,Casual,"January 2, 2022",The game is fun when you start you get a good amount but then when you're getting close in like the 9900 section you only get like 3 diamonds per round so plz fix that other than that it's pretty good it also doesn't take to long I've been on there for like 30 min and almost done.
508,Cut Grass,4.4,"53,134",Top Free,Casual,"January 5, 2022",The game would be a lot better if you could actually keep getting about the same amount of gems or higher amounts of coins. But if you just want something to relax with this is a good game.
509,Cut Grass,4.4,"53,134",Top Free,Casual,"December 30, 2021",This game is the worst! First of all every time I get gems they always give me robux ads every time I get gems. AND second it takes so long to get 10000 gems because it always gives me only 60 gems for completing the game!
510,Cut Grass,4.4,"53,134",Top Free,Casual,"January 2, 2022",I would give it a 5 star but for 2 reasons I gave it a 3 star 1. WHY IS 0.WHATEVER EXISTING RIGHT NOW! 2. Ads WAY TO MANY ADS.

512,Cut Grass,4.4,"53,134",Top Free,Casual,"January 2, 2022",The game itself is fun but when it comes to diamo and it goes to decimals like 0.009 it's ridicoulous and when I actually got the diamonds I needed it told me to watch 50 vidoes to activate the purchase total waste of my time
513,Cut Grass,4.4,"53,134",Top Free,Casual,"December 30, 2021",This game is so horrible you have to do this all night and all day it hurts my eyes. Got deleted wasting my time all day the worst thing to is ads up every single time and then the gym start lowering down to one 😡

522,Cut Grass,4.4,"53,134",Top Free,Casual,"January 3, 2022",I love the game because I've never had Robux before I am very happy that I can get it for free but the thing is every time you get diamonds there's an ad I do not like the ad just make him a little tiny adT_T please and also thank you I love the game.
523,Cut Grass,4.4,"53,134",Top Free,Casual,"January 3, 2022",Game is fun and all a little too many ads but when I reached 10k gems and tried to turn them in for robux was saying I didn't have enough and to check my balance
524,Cut Grass,4.4,"53,134",Top Free,Casual,"January 3, 2022",I gave this game a 4 stars because the ads tacke so long and it tackes so long to get 100000 gems and evry time i get a gem a ad pops up and it is agervating but besidesi love this game
525,Cut Grass,4.4,"53,134",Top Free,Casual,"January 2, 2022",After the game started giving me .009 or less I just deleted it plus the further on you go into the game the more ads you get and to get more gems you have to watch ads
526,Cut Grass,4.4,"53,134",Top Free,Casual,"January 2, 2022",I do like the game but the spamming with the ads and the gems getting smaller is annoying. I cant get my last Gem. I got 9999.7850. I'm starting to think this is a scam. The robux Is fake

557,Woodoku,4.4,"242,803",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 5, 2022",The ads aren't really a big deal yeah they're after every level but a level lasts 5-10 minutes so you really shouldn't be that bothered by it and obviously the game is going to give you harder pieces to use otherwise it wouldn't be challenging and you'd be here complaining about how you're bored
558,Woodoku,4.4,"242,803",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 29, 2021","I am seeing bad reviews and so will you if you look at the reveiw section. DEFINITELY won't download.

Having ads to play mini games that don't let you in after you watch the ad is also a problem. I recommend finding a game that is more focused on game experience over greed.

711,Prank Master 3D,4.4,"80,353",Top Free,Simulation,"August 12, 2021",This is the worst game ever! Whenever you pass or fail a level you get an ad and it cost 3 dollars to remove the ads it should be only like 2 dollars but it's 3. And pranks are supposed to be funny and fun but these pranks and so rude! Like it teaches kids how to break stuff and that's not fun.
712,Prank Master 3D,4.4,"80,353",Top Free,Simulation,"November 15, 2021",Game tends to freeze up and then sometimes you don't get your prize for that level. Other than that it's fun!
713,Prank Master 3D,4.4,"80,353",Top Free,Simulation,"July 23, 2021",Fun game....but an extreme amount of ads. I get ads pay for games and dont mind some ads but there is one every time you fail and every time you succeed...just a bit extreme. Seems fun aside from that.

This man is also in a curse, every time he does something in life he gets pranked. He can never escape the pranks. He smiles to hide the pain. Good game :)"
716,Prank Master 3D,4.4,"80,353",Top Free,Simulation,"September 3, 2021","Overall, a pretty decent game. I just wish it let you choose how you want to prank the characters instead of making you pick the ""correct"" prank."

720,Prank Master 3D,4.4,"80,353",Top Free,Simulation,"September 25, 2021",Very fun game. 1thing I don't really like is that it kind of shows kids that being mean is OK when it's really not. Other than that it's pretty fun.
721,Prank Master 3D,4.4,"80,353",Top Free,Simulation,"September 19, 2021","The pranks are very repetitive with the same person almost every time. The whole game also is based around ads with ever move having an ad along with one at the bottom of the screen at all times. TLDR: Too many ads, boring game"
722,Prank Master 3D,4.4,"80,353",Top Free,Simulation,"July 31, 2021",Ok I just started playing this and it's hilarious. Theres not that many ads and it's really fun for kids. And I'm 7 years old.
723,Prank Master 3D,4.4,"80,353",Top Free,Simulation,"July 26, 2021",Way to many adds. Also the pranks don't really make sense and the game will make you loose easily like you made a volcano to burn down the house but still fail the level because he can still cook his eggs

728,Water Sort - Color Puzzle Game,4.4,"574,529",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 3, 2022",Could be entertaining but ads are just too much. I understand having an ad every now and then but one after literally every single level is ridiculous. Plus it takes forever just to try to close the ad to get to the next level of the game.
729,Water Sort - Color Puzzle Game,4.4,"574,529",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 5, 2022","Paid for no ads and was worth it for a while, but after level 100 in that to watch add every other level anyway to get the xtra vial. It was either too hard/impossible or too easy... Seems like a ploy to get you to watch an add even after paying to skip them. Just moderate the difficulty!"

Every 5 levels they do a mystery puzzle, and personally, I can't stand them. If it was every 50 or so, it'd be fine, but i can't stand it.

731,Water Sort - Color Puzzle Game,4.4,"574,529",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 1, 2022",It's a good game and gets quite challenging (which I like). But there are long ads between every level and sometimes even if you just restart the level - and that is way too much. 2 1/2 ⭐️
732,Water Sort - Color Puzzle Game,4.4,"574,529",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 2, 2022",I think it would kinda fun if the game actually load and if you're actually lucky enough to get it to load then it locks up and just sits there. No point in playing if it won't work or play

I enjoy some mundane games I can get lost in and this one is too mundane even for me. It has too many ads which you are given neither choice nor reward for ensuring.

740,Water Sort - Color Puzzle Game,4.4,"574,529",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 31, 2021",I think this is a great app but I also agree to the other people about the ads and also do not pay your money and waste all your money for the ads to stop just press the home button clear everything off and go back on the game that really helps
741,Water Sort - Color Puzzle Game,4.4,"574,529",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 4, 2022","Good time waster, but to get anything out of it you need to actually pay to get rid of ads. Also paying to get rid of exactly get rid of ads because you still have to watch ads to get a third test tube. But you don't really need the third test tube if you're smart."
742,Water Sort - Color Puzzle Game,4.4,"574,529",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 19, 2021",So many forced ads. Makes the game unplayable. Theres an ad after every level without warning. Some of them have no way to go back to the game without exiting the whole game. Also slow and poor game mechanics. Not worth it.

If they really want to look into it they need to play the game for themselves and see the inconsistencies in action. Was good in concept, not in practice. Uninstalling."

858,Number Match - number games,4.4,"64,471",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 30, 2021","Often,I am confused as to why certain pairs are unacceptable. Sometimes the game will choose the same pair I've just tried thereby forcing me to use a hint unnecessarily. I think that there should be a more comprehensive paragraph on how the game is to be played types of matches work or don't work"

958,Money Rush,4.3,"54,737",Top Free,Casual,"December 19, 2021",I think it's a fun game but it's nothing like how the ads discribe it not to many ads please of your gonna make a game don't show something completely different then what the real game is
959,Money Rush,4.3,"54,737",Top Free,Casual,"January 3, 2022",Banner ads AND video ads? Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if you didn't have to press multiple X's to skip a video ad.

970,Money Rush,4.3,"54,737",Top Free,Casual,"November 20, 2021",I think there's a game in your ads 😳 but for real there's way too many damn ads. Like this game would be genuinely enjoyable if you didn't have to watch an add every level. Good riddance.
971,Money Rush,4.3,"54,737",Top Free,Casual,"November 30, 2021",Dont bother. A game takes maybe 10 seconds. Then it forces you to watch an ad after each game. Spend more time on ads than in the game. Super greedy game designers.

973,Money Rush,4.3,"54,737",Top Free,Casual,"November 3, 2021",I have a Samsung galaxy s20 5g ultra and the game does not load. Or it takes a long time to load then I play one game and it again takes a long time to load. Otherwise it's a fun game but the waiting gives it a one star

975,My Talking Angela 2,4.3,"862,067",Top Free,Casual,"December 31, 2021","This is a good game, however since there are ads already connected to makeup, powerups, free food Ect there should not be as many aggressive pop-up ads as there are! It makes it hard to enjoy the game for a longer period of time."

979,My Talking Angela 2,4.3,"862,067",Top Free,Casual,"December 20, 2021",The only reason I took 2 stars off is because it's difficult to get diamonds and all the good things are worth diamonds and the food bar never goes down and I already bought all of this food other than that it's a pretty good game.
980,My Talking Angela 2,4.3,"862,067",Top Free,Casual,"December 25, 2021",Super cool. Way more better than the first one. I my favorite thing well there two anyway there is bath bombs that are amazing. And it give you some new starter clothes. That's why I give it a 5

1127,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 31, 2021",Ads constantly interrupting play. Like before even being done with a level. Not even worth the time and the ads are false advertising. There are no guide points near the edge.
1128,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 5, 2022","Doesn't get any more challenging as you progress, rubber bands will snap to make it 100% every time, isn't precise with how you actually place them."
1129,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 2, 2022",I'm sorry but this game has wayyyyyyyyy to many adds every few seconds there is a add. That is why I gave one star ⭐ otherwise the game is good. If you hate games that have way to many adds do not get this game just letting you know.
1130,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 5, 2022",IM VERY UPSET RIGHT NOW THIS GAME IS SO FRUSTRATING AND I HAVE ANGER ISSUES AND I CRAKED MY SCREEN BECAUSE OF THIS STUPID GAME! I DONT RECOMMEND!!! Also there is no other buttons or such thongs you can press when you need help on a level no hints or anything!UGH!
1131,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 1, 2022","i can normally handle ads, but with each level taking no more than ten seconds to solve, having an ad after every single level is exhausting. not worth it."
1132,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 2, 2022",Ad on every level! I love the premise of the game but there is an ad on literally. Every. Level. Not worth the time to download and then delete.
1133,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 3, 2022",Played for less than a minute and got 5 ads! I'm okay with some ads but it interrupted the game way too much! Avoid this game like the plague until the devs get their thrash sorted.
1134,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 5, 2022",It's a fun game when you are offline but some levels won't work at all even tho I'm making the shape if they fixed that I would give it 4-5 stars
1135,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 4, 2022",The settings button is completely covered by my front sensor. I can't turn off the vibration. Also an ad every level is ridiculous
1136,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 31, 2021",Ewwww it vibrates any time you touch be screen. Also the ads are bad. The game idea is fun but the vibrating really kills the vibe for me.
1137,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 2, 2022",This game sucks. You just start do 1 sponge there is a ad. Then on the 5th or 6th level it's so difficult! If I could rate it a 0 I would
1138,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 2, 2022",There are ads during gameplay. This game is not like the ads and the vibration makes it worse but im pretty sure there is a button in settings that turns it off
1139,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 1, 2022",This game is good when it works every two levels it glitches out my phone and freezes it gets anyoning but when I can actually play the game it's fun
1140,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 6, 2022",The amount of ads in this game makes it unplayable. And the user interface is awful
1141,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 29, 2021",This is the worst game I've ever gotten!! I started playing it and it started making my phone buzz none stop and then it restarted my phone. I don't recommend this game but it could've been something else.
1142,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 4, 2022",Its a fun pluzzle game Only problem i have its so Ad heavy I spend more time watching ads than playing the game.
1143,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 2, 2022","Not a good game. 😕 Way too many commercials!!! 😒 I understand a few, but this is ridiculous!!!"
1144,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 14, 2021","Always an ad after a single ""level"" and there's only 72 or so and after that it just repeats the same things"
1145,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 4, 2022",it's a fun game but maybe could use some more systems bc it gets really repetitive but overall fun game
1146,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 4, 2022",It's a neat game but it vibrates like the whole time. The only break you get is during the adds after each completion
1147,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 2, 2022","This game is pretty fun but overall when you finish the rubber band thing before you can see how you did it has an add right away,and every single time you like make the thing its showing you right after it has an add but like I said it is a pretty good game overall.😊😇😊😇😊😇😊😇😊😇"
1148,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 31, 2021",I like it so far. I really love this game it is super fun some of them are hard but not to hard it's just like a puzzle game
1149,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 2, 2022",It's a good game till u get to a certain level I tried to play but it wouldn't let me put the rubber bands down so that why i gave it a three and I can't even get past level 5
1150,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 3, 2022",I'm on level 6 and I can't pass it! I'm trusting the rubber bands on the right place but it says I have 3 bands left and there are no hints so I'm just on level six.
1151,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 30, 2021",Entertaining game but are the ads after every level really necessary...just kind of puts a damper on the gameplay
1152,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 11, 2021","after you finish one, there is always an ad. and it doesnt even give you a pattern to follow to copy the pictures it gives you. I dont recommend at all"
1153,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 31, 2021","After 2 levels the ads start, and they happen after each level. Ridiculous"
1154,Sponge Art,4.2,"7,159",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 21, 2021",It would be a fun game if it weren't for the ads. They're incessant. It's unplayable.

They should also ad a search bar. And the last thing is that they should make a much bigger selection of all the songs you could play.Its a close one but l,ll recommend this game."
1187,Tiles Hop: EDM Rush!,4.2,"2,901,773",Top Free,Music,"January 6, 2022","This is most likely the best tiles hopping game out there, the other tiles hop game i've played are just the same songs. But in this one you can even play your own songs and lots of diffrent songs! If you are looking for a good tiles hop game then this is the game for you."
1188,Tiles Hop: EDM Rush!,4.2,"2,901,773",Top Free,Music,"January 3, 2022","I think it is great, but I do think that there should be more songs plus should make there songs that you can buy with coins so that you don't have to wait a million years to get a new song, but I'm not trying to criticize this is great game but these are things that bug me..."
1189,Tiles Hop: EDM Rush!,4.2,"2,901,773",Top Free,Music,"December 25, 2021","I really liked this game because it had all of the songs I like and I also liked how this was one of those ball jumping games from tile to tile. It was fun but I didn't like how everyone I died, there was an add that popped up. Other than that though, it was a pretty fun game to play!"
1190,Tiles Hop: EDM Rush!,4.2,"2,901,773",Top Free,Music,"January 1, 2022","Fun, but kind of dumb how it plays an ad AFTER you beat a level and BEFORE you play the next level. It's faster to just close and reopen the game after you finish a level and just go ahead and start watching the ad before playing the next level. You don't lose the score and you watch 1 less ad."
1191,Tiles Hop: EDM Rush!,4.2,"2,901,773",Top Free,Music,"January 5, 2022",I really like yeah because you get to listen to your favorite songs but when the square thing goes too fast sometimes it's very impossible for me to get.
1192,Tiles Hop: EDM Rush!,4.2,"2,901,773",Top Free,Music,"January 6, 2022",Its a good game but SO MANY ADS like you have to watch a ad to play a song you see one after you play a song its just too much.if yall fix the ad problem i might fully enjoy the game.
1193,Tiles Hop: EDM Rush!,4.2,"2,901,773",Top Free,Music,"December 27, 2021","Ads run during gameplay for real products, two at a time, and cycle very quickly to hit you with as many as possible. Jeep, Crest, Frontier, etc. etc. within each song (which seem to all be covers?) At the end, it displays a typical ad for another Android game like most others do, as well."
1194,Tiles Hop: EDM Rush!,4.2,"2,901,773",Top Free,Music,"January 2, 2022","Its a fun game, and it can be enjoyable, but only if youre patient enough to sit the insane number of ads.

1234,Phone Case DIY,4.2,"403,837",Top Free,Simulation,"January 2, 2022",I'm giving this game a 4 star because every time you click on something it's an ad. You can't do anything without watching an ad but otherwise its very fun creative but it's way to many ads.
1235,Phone Case DIY,4.2,"403,837",Top Free,Simulation,"January 2, 2022",I love this game but the only thing I don't like about is everything I click on something it allways has to show a ad and it would be very helpful if you took those away that's all I have to say bye.
1236,Phone Case DIY,4.2,"403,837",Top Free,Simulation,"January 4, 2022",I think this game is awesome because you can get creative and crafty and you can express your self. there are some adds but they don't bother me
1237,Phone Case DIY,4.2,"403,837",Top Free,Simulation,"December 25, 2021",It allows you to be creative and each customer potentially has requests but the rest is up to you. Lots of colors and attachments. The ads could be better but it's not s deal breaker. I recommend :)

1239,Phone Case DIY,4.2,"403,837",Top Free,Simulation,"December 23, 2021",The game is fine by itself. But the problem is that it had a ton of ads. And most of them implied something inappropriate and just downright tired to get kids to download the games. And not to mention it's mainly the same as playing over and over again.
1240,Phone Case DIY,4.2,"403,837",Top Free,Simulation,"December 29, 2021",It was AWFUL !! WAYYYY too may ads ad it keeps popping up eveytime I try t click on something I'm sick of it !! Instant uninstall! Don't waste your time trying to play this

1268,My Talking Tom Friends,4.2,"2,510,562",Top Free,Casual,"December 5, 2021",The reason I gave a 4 is I think it can improve a little bit I think should get more bathrooms uploaded for all the characters and add more stuff for all the characters and not have to pay for stuff on the game. 🐱🐱🐰🐱🐺:-):-):-):-):-)

1302,Hair Challenge,4.2,"827,679",Top Free,Action,"January 6, 2022",I use this app it's really really good but sometimes the quality can get really really good to you and doesn't really work so it does take away all the ads and all that and will take away all your reward and I'll play it back like nothing happened and that's the only downside for me
1303,Hair Challenge,4.2,"827,679",Top Free,Action,"December 27, 2021",So I was playing this game and I noticed that sometimes it doesn't make me have ads. That's great but sometimes I want a character and it says Ads aren't ready. I hate that about it but besides that it a good game!
1304,Hair Challenge,4.2,"827,679",Top Free,Action,"January 3, 2022",I love this game becouse you can obviously get as much hair as you want and just a few ads at a time. and little stress. you can unlock different characters at a time and you have to buy them with diamonds. thanks you for reading this comment! I hope you like it to.
1305,Hair Challenge,4.2,"827,679",Top Free,Action,"December 31, 2021","Firstly, I like this game cuz it is VERY satisfying to make your hair longer. The only thing I have to say about this is that the ads are BORING and the fact you have to watch 3 ads for one thing is really irritating. Otherwise, I give it 5 stars.😎"
1306,Hair Challenge,4.2,"827,679",Top Free,Action,"December 22, 2021",This game is pretty good the only thing is mine lagged. It got annoying fast but at the same time it might just be the tablet I'm using because It's pretty old. The other thing is it has so many adds yet I can't get items by choosing to watch an add.
1307,Hair Challenge,4.2,"827,679",Top Free,Action,"December 21, 2021",This game is super fun but almost every time I get on the app it tries to start me over or have a blank screen...please fix this problem and let me know when it's fixed so I can redownload it and give it a five star rating thanks in advance.

1309,Hair Challenge,4.2,"827,679",Top Free,Action,"December 23, 2021",I Think the problem might be the internet. I reccomend turning it off so that the lagging stops and you can finally enjoy the game.
1310,Hair Challenge,4.2,"827,679",Top Free,Action,"December 28, 2021",I love this game but it gets really annoying because it keeps repeating the same 2 ads
1311,Hair Challenge,4.2,"827,679",Top Free,Action,"December 11, 2021",hair challenges a really good game I love it so much it's about hair. Long hair and test how good you are at it.
1312,Hair Challenge,4.2,"827,679",Top Free,Action,"December 15, 2021",I like because I can earn diamonds but you can't unlock stuff you have to watch 3 videos first but uther wise it's a good game😁

1317,Hair Challenge,4.2,"827,679",Top Free,Action,"November 28, 2021",I like this game a lot but their is some complains the first one is that the game is to sensitive whenever you just barely touch it it just swerves way over next is the it will not make a sharp turn ever no matter how hard you try.. those are my review.
1318,Hair Challenge,4.2,"827,679",Top Free,Action,"November 27, 2021",It is a VERY good game at first but after a few levels it ducks and stops and glitches. I wish it still worked but it always stops workin. However if u do not want adds just turn off wifi. Over all I r ate it two stars.
1319,Hair Challenge,4.2,"827,679",Top Free,Action,"November 14, 2021",This game is okay. The hair sucks because the front part does not connect to the back. And the game lags so hard the levels are not fun to play. Either they are to hard or to easy.
1320,Hair Challenge,4.2,"827,679",Top Free,Action,"December 7, 2021",kinda hard to 100% levels via getting all hair but since this game doesn't count the % amount you finished a level it's fine. I enjoy how difficult this is for a mobile game like this.

1722,Ball Run 2048,4,"127,450",Top Free,Casual,"November 2, 2021",It is very fun but I would like it better if it had less ads and if it didn't start the level when you aren't ready.
1723,Ball Run 2048,4,"127,450",Top Free,Casual,"August 1, 2021","The person who plays the add acts very dumb. it says never play it on the add. so I hope they change it to good bc then ppl wont think that as you go up levels they wont think that, you get badder going up the levels. But it seems like a good game!!! 😃😃. so a four star!"
1724,Yes or No?! - Food Pranks,4,"53,712",Top Free,Casual,"December 27, 2021",I love this game but the only problems I have with it is that when it asks you if you want the item and it says no thanks and you press that it still gives you an ad that's my main problem but other than that I love this game so I rate it a two out of five
1725,Yes or No?! - Food Pranks,4,"53,712",Top Free,Casual,"December 19, 2021",The reason I give it a three is because it mostly doesn't make you play Yes OR No and I think it should have more of Yes OR No and a little bit of mini games you can play. But everything else is great 👍
1726,Yes or No?! - Food Pranks,4,"53,712",Top Free,Casual,"December 24, 2021",This is a fun little game but don't buy the no ads option for one for a $1.99 because it doesn't work you still get ads
1727,Yes or No?! - Food Pranks,4,"53,712",Top Free,Casual,"January 4, 2022","Good game, but can you make it so you have a higher chance to get the food prank game out of all the other games, please? Thank you."
1728,Yes or No?! - Food Pranks,4,"53,712",Top Free,Casual,"December 29, 2021",No too much ads I do not like it very glitchy it's just a no I would give it a zero but I can't it's just a waste of time and space
1729,Yes or No?! - Food Pranks,4,"53,712",Top Free,Casual,"December 21, 2021",Well the ads and outfits at least some not meant for kids it also repeats levels and 1 level it says kiss hotter not appropriate.
1730,Yes or No?! - Food Pranks,4,"53,712",Top Free,Casual,"December 5, 2021","Gameplay is choosing one of two options. Then decorating a room. The nicest decorations are 'bought' by watching an ad. Also, I was asked to rate the app immediately after I opened it."
1731,Yes or No?! - Food Pranks,4,"53,712",Top Free,Casual,"November 20, 2021",I give it 3 stars because the game has way too many ads after every game and on my screen it is very glitchy so I have to leave the game a lot. They also have to make new stuff to do because it's the same things over and over again.
1732,Yes or No?! - Food Pranks,4,"53,712",Top Free,Casual,"November 27, 2021",This game is fun. Just turn off wifi if you don't like the ads. I don't like how they make you watch an ad to go places. And I don't want to keep turning on wifi to do that. It is a fun and entertaining game. That is why I give it a 4 ⭐
1733,Yes or No?! - Food Pranks,4,"53,712",Top Free,Casual,"November 14, 2021",There is to many ads when I try and go passed level 2 it will not let me this is a very fun game but if you do not fix those problems I will be happy to uninstall 🚫 oh and I am trying to save up but it keeps on being stuff wth😡😡
1734,Yes or No?! - Food Pranks,4,"53,712",Top Free,Casual,"November 25, 2021",Didn't even get to level 1 when the ads started coming in nonstop! Unless you enjoy having ads after every round AND watching ads for extra money you should NOT play this game.
1735,Yes or No?! - Food Pranks,4,"53,712",Top Free,Casual,"November 30, 2021","The game is fun, but pretty much 90 percent of the time it's just minigames and not ""yes or no"" but it's a fun game nonetheless."
1736,Yes or No?! - Food Pranks,4,"53,712",Top Free,Casual,"December 11, 2021",I don't like this game it showed me a long long long very long ad completely uninstall!!!! Do not waste your time
1737,Yes or No?! - Food Pranks,4,"53,712",Top Free,Casual,"November 26, 2021",I just barely finished the first day before the ads started and the developers were asking me to rate the game. Very off-putting.
1738,Yes or No?! - Food Pranks,4,"53,712",Top Free,Casual,"November 25, 2021",So much fun and their a few games 🎮 I love this game a lot even you can unlock characters and you can use it that why I love this game🎮 I forgot can you please take the ads away thx 🎮

1740,Yes or No?! - Food Pranks,4,"53,712",Top Free,Casual,"November 27, 2021",I like the game but I hate that there is WAY TO MANY ADS EVERY ROUNG I HAVE TO WATCH A AD AND ITS TO MUCH AND THE GAME OS GLITCHY SO I GIVE THIS A 2 STAR
1741,Yes or No?! - Food Pranks,4,"53,712",Top Free,Casual,"November 24, 2021",I love this app it's a really good app there is no ads there is so many things to do whenever I'm bored I play it.
1742,Yes or No?! - Food Pranks,4,"53,712",Top Free,Casual,"November 29, 2021","At first it's sort of entertaining but then it gets dumb, boring. The same things stay to happen eventually."
1743,Yes or No?! - Food Pranks,4,"53,712",Top Free,Casual,"November 23, 2021",WORST GAME EVER! I just finished my first game and it already asked me for a rating. And after that you have to watch a 10-30 second add. I don't recommend this game at ALL.
1744,Yes or No?! - Food Pranks,4,"53,712",Top Free,Casual,"December 26, 2021",This game was terrible disappointment. So many breaks in playing. I think ever played a complete level. Can't cause you play a mini game for about 3 sec. Then it on with these ads. Please stop it too much. Where is the game of Yes or No?
1745,Yes or No?! - Food Pranks,4,"53,712",Top Free,Casual,"December 28, 2021","It's a good game but there are other games too and she takes so long to get to the closest to change, there is ads after every level and the mailman keeps coming to the house with almost the same thing"
1746,Yes or No?! - Food Pranks,4,"53,712",Top Free,Casual,"December 29, 2021",Honestly this game is kind of boring it's just the same thing over and over again also there are lots of ads I have please fix the problem of that
1747,Yes or No?! - Food Pranks,4,"53,712",Top Free,Casual,"November 6, 2021",First of all I completed level 1 and they already ask me to rate it? I just started!! Second. Too many ads. Third. I click a button twice and it buys something when I am trying to save up. Do not recommend this game. Play at your own risk
1748,Yes or No?! - Food Pranks,4,"53,712",Top Free,Casual,"November 22, 2021","This game has way way too many ad's for me and on top of that, it keep freezing up on me. That's why I decided to give it a one star. I really wash I could give it zero stars but that's not in option on here"
1749,Yes or No?! - Food Pranks,4,"53,712",Top Free,Casual,"November 14, 2021","WAY to many adds, the amount of adds are ridiculous. You spend more time watching adds then playing the game, pretty much everytime u complete ones game (games last for about 5 seconds). You have to watch an add for 25 to 30 seconds. 🙄"
1750,Yes or No?! - Food Pranks,4,"53,712",Top Free,Casual,"November 28, 2021",I love the game because it's is very active and you can learn different kind of pranks and jokes to do it to you sister brother and everyone in your whole entire family
1751,Project Makeover,4,"478,364",Top Free,Casual,"December 31, 2021",I have played this game for a while and like it. Recently it will just shut off in the of the game. Most times it's when you have just used gems or 1 move from winning. I have even won the level and shuts off and once I finally get it loaded back at the level just completed.
1752,Cat Paradise,4,"52,814",Top Free,Casual,"December 30, 2021","If you want my honest opinion, don't get this app. I've had this game for a week now and have been playing every day and am still not even close to recieving any rewards. There are far too many ads, and the game itself isn't even enjoyable. There are much better apps out there than this."
1753,Cat Paradise,4,"52,814",Top Free,Casual,"December 30, 2021","One thing about me is that I absolutely 💯 hate interruptions like ads. There are way to many ads. For example, before the game even loads there is an ad. But, overall it's a good game and it got me what I wanted which was robux.😁"
1754,Cat Paradise,4,"52,814",Top Free,Casual,"December 27, 2021","Love the game. So much faster and easier. But one thing is that there are less ads in this game than the others. It's easier to aquire diamonds to get robux for free. But, that doesn't mean I don't mind the ads. They're extremely annoying."
1755,Cat Paradise,4,"52,814",Top Free,Casual,"December 29, 2021","Garbage. When you get close to a ""reward"" you start getting .7 diamonds per new cat. Which kind you takes a good 30min to get to. The ads are inappropriate. And once I DID get enough for a reward the buttons went away."
1756,Cat Paradise,4,"52,814",Top Free,Casual,"January 6, 2022",Overall I really like this game but maybe make it a little easier to get robux and level up your cat and maybe reduce the ads a little bit because that is just constant in the game also maybe not spam some of the ads because I've gotten a lot of Lucky ads and it's getting kind of annoying 😅
1757,Cat Paradise,4,"52,814",Top Free,Casual,"December 31, 2021","1.There is way too many ads. When I open up the app, ad. Randomly, ad. 2. It's starts of giving you a lot of diamonds so you can get rewards, but later on it gives you 4, 2 and 1.5 diamonds."
1758,Cat Paradise,4,"52,814",Top Free,Casual,"December 29, 2021","Hi, I did as I was told in order to get the reward but after the 3-5 days were up for me to receive the reward, I still didn't get it, I'm not sure if it's a bug or what it is but I'm a little upset about it, anyways, have a good day/night."
1759,Cat Paradise,4,"52,814",Top Free,Casual,"December 30, 2021","This game takes forever I've spent hours and I hardly get any diamonds/gems, AND THERE ARE SO MANY ADS! And there are no rewards for it! All I have to say is dont waste your time on this game"
1760,Cat Paradise,4,"52,814",Top Free,Casual,"December 27, 2021","I gave it 1 star because of the one thing everyone hates, ads. AD here, ad there. it's annoying, why do they even call an add? you always need to watch an ad to get something , and oh! after an ad, you get a another one. Very Disappointing."
1761,Cat Paradise,4,"52,814",Top Free,Casual,"December 29, 2021","Ads every 30 seconds. Cats are cute, but every time I merge a cat I get an ad. But like the fact you made the ad for this game say ""get free robux"" is just no. I don't really recommend this game if your looking for a merge game."
1762,Investment Run,4,"17,756",Top Free,Arcade,"December 28, 2021","Game is very addictive, but when it give me the option to watch an ad to get an item or get more keys, it's not letting me. Other than that it's a very fun game! Side note: It will be fun when more competitive companies are added."
1763,Investment Run,4,"17,756",Top Free,Arcade,"December 28, 2021","It's a pretty dumb game. I don't care about the ads. Creators gotta make money. But the game is super easy. I have only lost money once, however I knew the answer because I had gotten the same thing twice and was curious what would happen. The game is not worth playing."
1764,Investment Run,4,"17,756",Top Free,Arcade,"January 2, 2022","lags so hard when it comes to any fast movement, large amounts of cash, flying to your island. when it comes to the lag you go through the cash without collecting it."
1765,Investment Run,4,"17,756",Top Free,Arcade,"December 28, 2021","This is a good game for me at least, in my opinion at times there can be glitchy movement or anything but not as many adds as I expected. It's a decent game."
1766,Investment Run,4,"17,756",Top Free,Arcade,"January 4, 2022",It's fun but there are so many ads and all the levels are basically the same like 90% of the choices are the same
1767,Investment Run,4,"17,756",Top Free,Arcade,"December 31, 2021","Game is boring, amount of adds is excessive. I know the creators have to make money, but a freemium game is not the way"
1768,Investment Run,4,"17,756",Top Free,Arcade,"December 27, 2021","Too many ads. I understand having them every other time you play, but this game is something else."
1769,Investment Run,4,"17,756",Top Free,Arcade,"January 2, 2022",Theirs way too many ads their literally a ad after every single level but the game is fun just too many ads.
1770,Investment Run,4,"17,756",Top Free,Arcade,"October 18, 2021","The game is stupid simple and while I initially liked the idea of picking a company to invest in, it's the same 3-4 companies throughout all of the levels! And of coarse there is a 30 second ad in between each 10 second level. It's and ad farm and it's terrible."
1771,Investment Run,4,"17,756",Top Free,Arcade,"November 11, 2021","This is such a stupid game. You can't go more than 30 seconds without an ad in the game, and the actual game play is so abysmal and dumb that not even a toddler would find its simple loop entertaining. Save your time and don't download this dumb game."
1772,Investment Run,4,"17,756",Top Free,Arcade,"November 19, 2021",its okay at first..the ivestments are repetitive..so its easy to pick the right ones..lots of ads..dont mind ads. but if you ay for a half an hour you will watch 18 minutes worth of ads..definitely more ads than game play..even if you chose no thanks on things you get ads forced on you.
1773,Investment Run,4,"17,756",Top Free,Arcade,"November 21, 2021",I like the game idea but its just to much ads I do not recommend downloading this game it just to much ads!!!!! plus there are inappropriate ads if I where you I would get a parent's opinion on this game definitely age 12 + you can't even get 30 seconds in without an ad please take my advice please
1774,Investment Run,4,"17,756",Top Free,Arcade,"December 4, 2021",Meh... Ok if you're super bored and have nothing else to do.... Unfortunately the game is super repetitive and repeate the same investment questions over and over again.... There's no risk at all..... I wish the game was more challenging in regards to that aspect....
1775,Investment Run,4,"17,756",Top Free,Arcade,"October 15, 2021","you don't have to make the characters dance just for it to be a good game. I can make the character I'm playing get a single buck after losing a bunch and they're dancing, happily, what a mess."
1776,Investment Run,4,"17,756",Top Free,Arcade,"October 15, 2021","Everything worked great, but what's the point of the game if all the ""correct"" answers are always green and the ""wrong"" ones are always red? That defeats the whole purpose of the game. There's no choice."
1777,Investment Run,4,"17,756",Top Free,Arcade,"October 23, 2021","The game crashed once I hit level three, I thought it was because of my phone (being that it is only a $30 Walmart phone) but it kept doing it at the same level once I hit the stairs to go to the helicopter."
1778,Investment Run,4,"17,756",Top Free,Arcade,"December 13, 2021",I really like the concept of this game. Unfortunately though the game restarted my progress back to square one. I didnt delete the game prior to the reset.

1794,Investment Run,4,"17,756",Top Free,Arcade,"November 13, 2021","This game is very fun but one problem is that the calculations are incorrect like I got 1,894 cash and I watch an ad to spin the wheel I got 5× I got 9,475 cash but I used my calculator and it showed that 1,894×5=9,470 not 9,475 although pretty fun game"

It always took a long time (more than a minute) to load, which would have been enough for a 2 star review, but now that it no longer loads, I was compelled to write a review and thus it is a single star review and I am uninstalling."
1839,Lumber Empire: Idle Tycoon,4,"184,615",Top Free,Simulation,"December 17, 2021","This game is fun to start then falls off quickly. The scaling they use for advancing through the game gets out of wack after not too long. And apparently the income multiplier doesn't work after a certain point? Whatever, this game has more glitches than...a thing with a lot of glitches."
1840,Lumber Empire: Idle Tycoon,4,"184,615",Top Free,Simulation,"January 3, 2022",At a point where I can't do anything due to game freezing up. Have updated as much as I can and it's still locked up. Production has come to a grinding hault. If you Uninstall and reinstall you lose all your progress made. Updates need to be either weekly or every other week
1841,Lumber Empire: Idle Tycoon,4,"184,615",Top Free,Simulation,"December 14, 2021",This game is fun. Yes you have ads like any other game but you just wait the 29 seconds or do something else while it count downs. You get free diamonds daily and lots of free chests .I haven't spent a dime on this game yet and still enjoy it. Mindless really when I need a time out from the world.
1842,Lumber Empire: Idle Tycoon,4,"184,615",Top Free,Simulation,"December 24, 2021","Was fun at first. But it's just the same thing over and over and each level you complete everything gets slower and slower even after upgrading things from the previous level, you just basically just start over after each ""level"" very very boring."
1843,Lumber Empire: Idle Tycoon,4,"184,615",Top Free,Simulation,"December 20, 2021",This Game is Definitely Fun! I was amazed to find out that you can Actually walk the factory and see the machines and everyone working 🤪 I was skeptical about downloading it because of all of the reviews were mostly bad. But I can't complain I love it!
1844,Lumber Empire: Idle Tycoon,4,"184,615",Top Free,Simulation,"December 11, 2021","Don't buy the ad free service, it's a scam. When you have ads, you can spend 30 seconds continuously to speed up your progress. If you go ad free, you get put on a cooldown for the things that speed up the game and some are like once an hour instead of every 5 mins if you watch an ad."
1845,Lumber Empire: Idle Tycoon,4,"184,615",Top Free,Simulation,"December 14, 2021",Been playing for a couple of weeks and enjoying the game (spending a little money). Now a new update screen pops up that you can't get past. My only option is to Uninstall or Play and both loop back to the New Update dialog. Uninstallinf and REALLY want my money refunded.
1846,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"December 28, 2021","This was an good game but it does seem to lag and glitch a lot. And now, whenever it is trying to switch to an adz which is almost after ever level, all I see is a black screen and I have to force myself out of the game and back in. Very frustrating and annoying."
1847,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"January 3, 2022","Good game but way too many ads, you crash and then it asks you if you want to watch an ad to get revived, then if you say no it makes you watch it anyway."
1848,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"December 28, 2021","It's a fun game, and I like that it gets harder as it goes on. But there are SO MANY ads! I just stopped playing because of the ads, level, ad, level, ad. I wouldn't recommend."
1849,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"December 31, 2021","I get the need for ads, but this is rediculous. Play a 5 second level, watch a 30 second ad. Rinse and repeat every level."
1850,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"December 21, 2021",Each level lasts about 5 seconds and then you spend 15-30 seconds watching an ad after EVERY level. It's ridiculous. The game isn't fun enough to outweigh the amount of ads.
1851,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"December 31, 2021","The ads, good lord the ads. Can't through a single level without the ads. Great idea for a game but the creators went about it wrong."
1852,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"December 23, 2021",I downloaded this game from an ad and was simply disappointed. I opened the app and the title screen was laggy. Once it finally opened I get onto the first level only for it to freeze. I retried many times and it just did not work. I wouldn't recommend downloading this. Please fix your game!!
1853,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"December 22, 2021","Great game, but to many ads. After every time I complete a level, there is an ad. So, I say download it if you want a fun game and a lot of ads."
1854,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"December 18, 2021",This game is very good! Ads are balanced out. It can also get kids an early view of driving. The game it not laggy or glitchy. It is also not gory so its suitable for kids. This game is great!
1855,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"December 24, 2021",Too many advertisements. After every single level it's an advertisement. I'd understand if after every couple but every single one and the levels aren't that long. I don't recommend this game to anyone.
1856,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"December 26, 2021",I hated this game. The levels were way too easy and there was an ad after every single level. No one likes ads. I have a question for the makers of this game: Have you ever heard of fun?!
1857,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"December 25, 2021",Complete adware ! Played only six levels after every single level which is only around 12 seconds long. I get spammed with ad after ad complete garbage. Good idea for a game but still garbage
1858,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"December 3, 2021","Game play is simple and levels are short. A level will last a few seconds and after every level, you're met with an ad. I normally download random games, even if they're riddled with ads, but this one gets to me."
1859,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"December 24, 2021","Fun, but unfortunately, waaaaay to many commercials. Every run takes about 5-10 seconds then you get a 30 second commercial. No balance to the fun to commercial ratio. Uninstalled."
1860,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"December 27, 2021","Wish I could rate this a 0. You don't even have to try and time the car... it never hits if you hold the button down as soon as the level starts. Also, an ad between every level? Disgusting."
1861,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"December 21, 2021",IT IS SO GLITCHY!!! every single level without fail it will glitch. Please fix this so I can enjoy the game! I have had it on a few phones and reinstalled multiple times hoping it would go away but it hasn't
1862,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"January 1, 2022","It's an okay game, but the ads ruin it. Not even a ten second game and it gives you a two minute ad. Promotion, yes, but playtime and watchtime aren't balanced out. Download if you want to uninstall it minutes later."
1863,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"January 2, 2022","2 Star Rating From Me, I Love this Game BUT it's one of those Ad overload Games And I see Many of the same ads That I Continue To NOT download But of Course that's in my opinion!"
1864,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"December 31, 2021",It was short. So many adds😠😠😠😠after every level .It was ok. But really easy. You probably don't want to download this.
1865,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"December 17, 2021","I absolutely 100% love this game....but ALL THOSE ADDS. pls take some of the ads away pls ty. But overall...this game is fun. Also, it glitches sometimes. Pls fix dat.great. ty. Ttyl!"
1866,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"December 22, 2021",It's fun in all but every single level when youre done an advert pops up and I'm only on level 3 so I don't recommend this game if this was helpful thank you and maybe remove to adverts
1867,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"January 2, 2022",Terrible! Way to many ads. 30 seconds of ads for every 5 seconds of gameplay. Dont waste your time or support them
1868,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"December 9, 2021","If you played this for 40min, it would end up that 34mins of it was ads. I'm deleting it become it's also usually the same ad. The levels are for 4 year olds and not difficult."
1869,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"November 24, 2021",there is a way to stop all the ads every 5 seconds TURN OFF YOUR DANG WIFI STUPIDS.There problem solved. But anayway this game is amazing. its so cool.and it is a fun game to play when you on roadtrips. And 1 more thing I AM NOT A ROBOT
1870,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"January 2, 2022",It is entertaining when you have nothing to do even when you are on the road and the challenges are so fun they may be easy but they are super fun
1871,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"December 18, 2021","This game is ok, but there are SO MANY ADDS! The levels are really short, and I have to watch a 30 second, unskipable ad. Would not recommend."
1872,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"November 11, 2021",Lame. Lags. Cannot play for bombarding ads. I get that the developers have to make money but this game is so lame it is not worth sitting thru ads. Half the time the game won't load back up after the ad is finished.
1873,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"November 6, 2021",Lol but there is like a glitch where you like fly of the map and I know cause I am off the map right now and i am laughing Lol!! Good game btw. And 1 more glitch like what in the world was going on with that bus it was facing diagonally LOL
1874,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"December 29, 2021",Ad after ad after ad every round. I don't mind ads in games but my goodness. I'm out.
1875,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"December 10, 2021","Each round is very short, and of course an ad plays between each round. But it's a satisfying little game."
1876,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"December 22, 2021","Game wouldn't even load and you only get one level to sample on the ""try now"" option, and it's the one you play on the sample game. Kept making my phone crash after installation and wouldn't even open afterwards."
1877,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"December 27, 2021",After level 10 there is a long ad after each run. Not worth the wait. Uninstalled after 3 minutes.
1878,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"November 7, 2021","Fun so far! Watch out for the ""headlights"" coming....there's little hints to let ya know when cross traffic is coming! Will update my review after I've played game for awhile~Pretty EASY in beginning, but we'll see....."
1879,Traffic Run!,4,"267,064",Top Free,Action,"January 3, 2022",You get an ad every level you complete. This game is solely for the ads. Do not recommend
1880,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"January 4, 2022","Game is enjoyable. Easy to play. My complaint is at the end of a race you kick a rag doll, if it lands on the treasure chest, that's it. The game does not advance. Freezes. Yes there are ads."
1881,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"December 28, 2021",This game is an Ad-pocolypes. You cant even pay for an ad free version because they force you to watch to upgrade. Pro tip: keep airplane mode on and when it ask to connect just flip it on for a few seconds and shut it off again. This will skip all ads.
1882,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"January 5, 2022",The ads in this game automatically install software when you try to close them. I don't care how many ads there are but trying to sneak software into my phone is inexcusable.
1883,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"December 28, 2021",Yse the ads are insane but by now ya'll should know and expect these sorts will have that many ads. It's a fun app game but with the amount it ads it's defining install play for 20 minutes and Uninstall sort of fun.
1884,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"January 5, 2022","It is exactly like the trailer. Good for situations like the DMV. Good bit of adds though, with 2 playing in between each level."
1885,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"January 5, 2022",Just another clickbait game you can't skip ads all hype. Be prepared to be struck by heavy advertising and very little actual game play!
1886,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"January 5, 2022",Fun game. If the guy you kick at the end of the level lands on the chest the game doesnt move on.
1887,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"January 5, 2022",It's simply awesome to slap on the run and kicking like it's a field goal upon holy sights on four heads up on yonder my friends! Nice gameplay thank you.
1888,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"December 29, 2021",Impossible to play with the amount of ads that pop up.... It's too bad because it is fun to play.... I'm going to miss you Slap & Run
1889,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"January 4, 2022",More ads than game play and they won't let you play offline. Shame because the concept is fun too
1890,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"January 6, 2022",very relaxing amazing for tough times I love the sound effects when you slap or kick someone 5 stars need to play game.
1891,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"January 4, 2022","It's boring after a day and don't but the no adds thing bc it does nothing it still gives you adds if you wanna get revived or go for a spin and so on,the only add that went away was the one after you die but still is useless"
1892,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"December 14, 2021",I love it but why am I STILL GETTING ADS?! I paid the 2.99. Fix or refund my money. Thank you.
1893,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"January 4, 2022","Won't run without a data connection yet, you can't play a level w/o an ad so.... uninstalled just like my other VOODOO games 🙄"
1894,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"January 3, 2022","You might think paying for no ads would stop you from having to watch ads, but you'd be wrong. There are still some upgrades you can't buy with coins, you have to watch more ads to get them even after paying to get rid of ads"
1895,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"December 19, 2021",Even if you pay for the ad free version you will still gonna have to see the videos ads after each level .👎👎👎
1896,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"January 1, 2022","It's actually a really fun game however as all the other reviews have said, FAR TOO MANY ADS! I purchased the no ads for $2.99 and it does absolutely nothing to take away the ads. They literally try to steal $2.99 from you lol luckily I was able to get it refunded!"
1897,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"December 31, 2021","Slap and Run is fun but, it's a bit boring at times. The levels don't change much and it's not very hard to win. There's no character customization, and The background characters are always the same. Overall pretty fun but could use more creativity."
1898,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"December 30, 2021","Pretty fun game BUT the ads are absolutely ridiculous!!! Not worth a 10 sec game play for a 40 sec ads!!!!! There's a ad before you play, if you die and when you reach the end and there is also a ad at the bottom of your screen, I will not be playing or keeping this game!"
1899,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"January 5, 2022","This is really fun to play (In my opinion) and it's really fun to play for me because my siblings are really annoying, So I imagine the people as my siblings 🙂👍 I would recommend on playing this. I also turn off my wifi access when I'm playing (I'm on Android) so the ads won't bother me^^"
1900,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"December 21, 2021",Decent game but wayy too many ads- not worth it since it also caused performance issues with my phone. No thanks. 👎
1901,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"December 31, 2021","Thought the game was hilarious. But the ads made it frustrating. I paid for the ""ad free"" version and feel like I got screwed over. It's not free from ads and just as frustrating as ever!"
1902,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"January 2, 2022","It is fun to play. I dont like how I can't redo a level. I want to be able to get a perfect slap run. The ads are a downer to, get busy on an update gang."
1903,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"December 31, 2021",After every turn there are 2 unskipable adds about 30 seconds each. Then if you want to upgrade stuff you have to watch another 30 sec unskipable add. After about 2 minutes of adds you get to finally do your 30 second run of slaps. Now back to commercials!
1904,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"December 14, 2021",Game = fun. Ads after EVERYTHING freaking SUCKED! ***WARNING*** DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Unless you don't mind dual 20 second ads every 10 seconds. Playing the game allows me to give 1 star...would give only 1/2 if I could. Could be good but dang the ads are like a cloud of knats and you are sweaty. 🤣
1905,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"December 21, 2021","Its pretty fun and I enjoy the simplicity, but the constant ads make it pretty annoying. Also, I understand that the point of the game is to slap people, but I just think it's really weird that you're slapping women's butts. It's kinda gross."
1906,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"January 4, 2022","I love it. I love the sound of the slaps lol. I just hate the ads theyre annoying,"
1907,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"January 4, 2022",Should have called this game ad city. 20 seconds of game = 4 minutes of ads. Uninstalled.
1908,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"January 2, 2022","This game is soo much fun, but I know you have to have ads, but when the ads end, you can't go right back to the game (lame)! I know it doesn't make a difference to anyone, but I am going to delete the game."
1909,Slap and Run,3.9,"12,604",Top Free,Arcade,"December 28, 2021","I gave this 1 star because although it was fun, the ads were way too excessive. I can understand maybe after 3 or 4 levels, but after every level?? Nah, it just ruined the game for me."
1910,Pull the Pin,3.9,"340,460",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 4, 2022","Description of game is nothing like what you download. Ads are forced upon you, you can remove ads at a daily price, otherwise you will be unable to play game because of being bombarded with ads. If this is the only way developers can make money on app, then they'll be broke soon. Uninstalling"
1911,Pull the Pin,3.9,"340,460",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 4, 2022",It's kinda fun but so many adds so frequently. In the first ten minutes of playing I spent more time waiting for ads to end than I did playing the game. It was easy for me to loose interest. Deleted this app 10 minutes after I downloaded it. Too many ads too frequent.
1912,Pull the Pin,3.9,"340,460",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 2, 2022",I'm actually pretty disappointed. I paid for the paid version thinking that ads would go away. Any time you do an extra bonus puzzle THERE IS ANOTHER AD!! EVERY PUZZLE! it's maddening and I want my money back. If I paid for no ads why do I still have ads????? Would not recommend.
1913,Pull the Pin,3.9,"340,460",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 30, 2021","So inanely simple it's only useful to teach toddlers problem-solving. Dare I say the only reason this 'game' exists is to generate ad revenue with ads every level or 2. Additionally, even when I turn off the sound and vibration, the next time I launch the game those settings aren't saved. YMMV."
1914,Pull the Pin,3.9,"340,460",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 30, 2021","Extremely easy and repetitive. No fun factor. If you beat 10 levels, you've played the game. Sure, after a hundred levels you've earned enough coin to change the visuals, but the mechanics don't change. It's a brainless, boring waste of time."
1915,Pull the Pin,3.9,"340,460",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 5, 2022",I can't really enjoy the game because there is way way way too many commercials and ads! Definitely going to be uninstalling! I hate watching ads and commercials!! So if you like lots of commercials and ads this is definitely the game for you!!!
1916,Pull the Pin,3.9,"340,460",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 28, 2021","10% game play, 90% advertising. This game isn't even completed yet, apparentlyit'sstillunderconstruction! I've reached over 6 million points, and keep seeing ""coming soon"" signs. Meanwhile it's just the same thing over and over and over again! Boring!!!"
1917,Pull the Pin,3.9,"340,460",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 3, 2022",Just an ad engine. Want to play? Watch an ad. Need a hint? Watch an ad. Accidentally tap the wrong thing? Watch an ad. And this was just the first 10 levels which are mostly teaching you how to play. Not wasting any more time with this.
1918,Pull the Pin,3.9,"340,460",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 28, 2021","I don't mind watching ads to play a game for free but when there are ads every time I complete a 5 second level I end up spending more time watching ads then actually playing the game. Too simple, too many ads, boring and annoying."
1919,Pull the Pin,3.9,"340,460",Top Free,Puzzle,"December 31, 2021","Not what was advertised. I was expecting something more physics based and this is just an elaborate puzzle of ""what order do I pull the pins"" without a whole lot the physics based advertisements. And thank God for my ad blocker. Cause that would have been annoying as hell otherwise."
1920,Pull the Pin,3.9,"340,460",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 1, 2022",Fun game but because of all the ads I only gave it 2 Stars. I play about three rounds and then an add pops up and then another ad pops up. so annoying I just want to play it. I waste more time on the ads than the actual game.

1922,Pull the Pin,3.9,"340,460",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 3, 2022",The game is far too simple. When I don't have to think about a level and finish in three seconds I don't want to watch 30s of ads. If it were a little more fun and challenging I'd be motivated to pay for ad free. Will uninstall.
1923,Pull the Pin,3.9,"340,460",Top Free,Puzzle,"January 4, 2022",There are ads after every single level of this game.Also this game is too easy. So you spend even more time watching ads. There are much funner games out there you just need to find them. Good luck. Happy hunting.

I have earned the same puzzle pieces over and over and can't complete a puzzle. The gift boxes are also glitched. I watch the ad and the box doesn't open.

Maybe my app just glitched out but there was nothing more to conquer after the regions of the US and no way to build up more than one island. It doesn't get harder as you play - once you've won once, you've won every time."

And you get like to adds. I got far enough to start building my place and I have about 5 minutes of adds. One or two after each build. Delete game after two days
1927,Count Masters - Stickman Clash,3.9,"237,356",Top Free,Action,"January 6, 2022",The fun lasted for maybe 5 minutes after downloading. Too many ads and the game isn't challenging.

Games like these shouldn't require a 1000 dollar gaming PC to run. Ads are also annoyingly frequent. You get an ad after almost every level. I'd recommend looking elsewhere for a game, until they fix the lag."

Seriously doesn't start out bad, there is enough mix to keep you mildly entertained. Then the ads start over and over. After every level. Battles cannot be beat on first two attempts and you have to watch ads."

The main game is very addicting, but you can also use the map icon to attack and gain territory using awards that you won from the main game.

This isn't a game it's a book with a pop up game every few pages. So annoying. I don't mind watching ads to play a free game but game play time has to be greater than ad watching time for it to be worth the space on my phone.
1936,Count Masters - Stickman Clash,3.9,"237,356",Top Free,Action,"January 1, 2022","So. Many. Ads! Every level required you to watch an ad. Every bonus required you to watch an ad. I was watching two or three ads, per level. I'm uninstalling now."

1940,Count Masters - Stickman Clash,3.9,"237,356",Top Free,Action,"December 28, 2021",Only for advertising. It is a so-so game where you spend the majority of your time watching long advertisements. If the advertisements were every 4 levels instead of every level it might be worth playing.
1941,Count Masters - Stickman Clash,3.9,"237,356",Top Free,Action,"December 25, 2021","Mindless entertainment, which is reasonably fun. Problem is that you can do virtually nothing without ads. It's very clear that this is nothing more than a vehicle for showing ads rather than a real game."

1949,Magic Tiles 3,3.9,"2,748,396",Top Free,Music,"January 2, 2022",Magic tiles 3 is a fun game. You pick a song from a long list. Then you play a piano like thing to the beat of the song. The songs sound a little different but you can still tell what they are. Over all the game is fun and can keep you entertained. I would give it 4.5 stars of of 5.

2217,Color Match,3.2,"14,971",Top Free,Casual,"December 30, 2021","Ok, so this game is pretty fun the first time you play it! Until...Adds pop up every two seconds. I get that the game needs money and I'm not one to complain, but if I wanted ""draw it!"" then I'd get it. I would not recommend for users who actually want to play the game not watch adds!"
2218,Color Match,3.2,"14,971",Top Free,Casual,"January 1, 2022","The number of ads is utterly ridiculous. Every 30 seconds or so. Also, the game is rated E and the first ad I saw involved a pair of women playing rock paper scissors of who is going to slap the others breasts or butt. Both are scantily clad. Wildly inappropriate for a children's game."
2219,Color Match,3.2,"14,971",Top Free,Casual,"December 31, 2021",Only ads. Not even sure if they have an option to buy an ads free version because I only got to play one level. No chance to try the game. Got several ads and every time I think it's done it takes me to the game screen for 2 seconds then plays another ad.
2220,Color Match,3.2,"14,971",Top Free,Casual,"December 23, 2021",Can i have some game with the ads? I mean it's ridiculous. I finished painting my third fruit and I can't press continue because of the non stop ads. This would actually be a Good game but...ads oh and what's over there? More ads. What about that? Yet another ad.
2221,Color Match,3.2,"14,971",Top Free,Casual,"December 24, 2021",This game did nothing but close down and stop working immediately. I was able to open it up but as soon as I tried to move something the game crashed. I tried downloading on a different WiFi network and Uninstalling after a couple tries. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP IT IS A WASTE OF TIME.
2222,Color Match,3.2,"14,971",Top Free,Casual,"December 26, 2021","I love the idea of the game. It seems fun, I had the first ad after making one color. And was ok with it. But after awhile, It started getting annoying. There are way to much ad's. I feel as if there weren't as many ad's you guys would have at least 4 starts."
2223,Color Match,3.2,"14,971",Top Free,Casual,"December 23, 2021",All the reviews about the ads are not exaggerating. All I did was start the game and 3 ads played back to back. Literally as the game was starting up. I finally played 1 round which takes a couple seconds and another ad automatically played without clicking anything.
2224,Color Match,3.2,"14,971",Top Free,Casual,"January 1, 2022","I just got this game, there is so many ads, first of all as soon a press on the app it gave me no stop ads. I got three whole ads and could not skip them and that was as soon as I got on, it's just a really stupid game, parents DO NOT GET THIS GAME FOR YOUR KID."
2225,Color Match,3.2,"14,971",Top Free,Casual,"January 1, 2022",Yea I can't even play the game. I go to touch a color or hit continue and an ad pops up. After the ad finishes I go to try to tap again and another ad pops up. 4 ads in a row and I just gave up. No thank you.
2226,Color Match,3.2,"14,971",Top Free,Casual,"December 23, 2021",So many ads that it makes the game unenjoyable. Played the first level and had 6 ads in between the time I started the level to the time I finished it. Let me know when they chill with them because the game itself was fun.
2227,Color Match,3.2,"14,971",Top Free,Casual,"January 1, 2022","I mean, theres not a lot of ads, but it is laggy. Not so laggy to where it would get lower than 2/3 stars, but laggy enough to make you get a little frustrated. I wouldn't reccomend, but I also wouldn't not reccomend..."
2228,Color Match,3.2,"14,971",Top Free,Casual,"December 24, 2021",Very poor game. Buggy and way too many ads. I had 5 ads just for one game of color match. Uninstalled immediately. It was a shame because it would have been a game that I would have liked.
2229,Truth Runner,3.2,"14,794",Top Free,Casual,"December 26, 2021",So many ads. Soooo many ads. It's unplayable. Literally 5 seconds of game play for a 30 second ad. Not to mention the ads are very... sexual?? On a game seemingly for children. It's gross. The game itself also has weird sexual type things. It's just not good.
2230,Truth Runner,3.2,"14,794",Top Free,Casual,"January 4, 2022","This game absolutely sucks. It would give me notifications, but not let me play the games. It would also move the character to the opposite direction that I was moving it to. The ads would also ruin the fun."
2231,Truth Runner,3.2,"14,794",Top Free,Casual,"January 2, 2022","The test was fine, but WAY too laggy, and I kept getting the wrong items, I ended up with ""soft"" on the first level, and then couldn't even get to the next one! 2 stars for laggy, but kinda ok test."
2232,Truth Runner,3.2,"14,794",Top Free,Casual,"December 31, 2021","Honestly this is one of the worst games I've played, it drains my battery, the lag is at an ungodly level, the stereotyping in this game is atrocious, this game needs so much fixed... And don't get me started on how many annoying ads there are."
2233,Truth Runner,3.2,"14,794",Top Free,Casual,"December 25, 2021","I mean it's an okay game but it always glitches out. It's always giving me notifications about the ""best"" activities, but when I join game it's not giving me those ""best"" activities. I'm just going to give it at least two stars"
2234,Truth Runner,3.2,"14,794",Top Free,Casual,"January 5, 2022",The sheer number of ads make this unplayable. The worst over are the ones in the MIDDLE of levels! This game is a front to get you to make developers money by watching ads. 🙄
2235,Truth Runner,3.2,"14,794",Top Free,Casual,"January 2, 2022","Boring. And the ads are kinda weird... And speaking about the ads, The ads come up every single level! Maybe in the middle. Anyways, Happy new years!"
2236,Truth Runner,3.2,"14,794",Top Free,Casual,"January 4, 2022",It is a ok app i will play it some time if i am bored but it is really lage and there are so many ads and the ads are really impropriety for kids and when i play whith my sister i have to cover my phone because of the ads
2237,Truth Runner,3.2,"14,794",Top Free,Casual,"December 26, 2021",This is a horrible game!The ads are VERY inappropriate and the ads happen every like 3 seconds.I get that ads are good for the app but mabye people would get it if there was not ads so often.one star for sure.
2238,Truth Runner,3.2,"14,794",Top Free,Casual,"December 30, 2021",This game is not good first of all just bc I play video games doesn't mean I'm a boy next it's so slow the last thing is why are ads so not important at all if you want a 5 🌟's I recommend you fix this this app I'm deleting it
2239,Truth Runner,3.2,"14,794",Top Free,Casual,"December 22, 2021",I like the game but I don't like the ads. They make me uncomfortable and I have to throw down the phone every time an ad pops up. Please fix this
2240,Truth Runner,3.2,"14,794",Top Free,Casual,"December 31, 2021",It's nice and all but the ads are overwhelming I can't play for 5 seconds without an ad fix and I'll maybe download it again
2241,Truth Runner,3.2,"14,794",Top Free,Casual,"January 3, 2022",I enjoyed the game but the notifications I was getting from the game were mildly inappropriate maybe try fixing that and it might get a better rating
2242,Truth Runner,3.2,"14,794",Top Free,Casual,"December 26, 2021",The ads are NOT FOR KIDS they are inappropriate and should be taken down and it tells you your gender by your CLOTHES this game deserves 1 star from EVERYONE and it's laggy and boring when I say please I mean PLEASE DONT DOWNLOAD IT
2243,Truth Runner,3.2,"14,794",Top Free,Casual,"January 1, 2022",okay game but the ads are disgusting and the characters are extremely stereotyped. way too many ads. would not recommend
2244,Truth Runner,3.2,"14,794",Top Free,Casual,"December 26, 2021",It always seems to show me that there are always good things about it and then when I get on there's nothing good it's just what it normally is and it glitches
2245,Truth Runner,3.2,"14,794",Top Free,Casual,"December 26, 2021",This game is so bad Its ads are trash and has low graphics its very very bad. I wish i could have rated it 0 stars.
2246,Truth Runner,3.2,"14,794",Top Free,Casual,"January 2, 2022",First of all when you beat a leavel there don't let you click next leavel they have you look at an ad and it takes SOOOO LONG TOOO LOAD BRUH STOP SHOWING GIRLS IN ADS THAT ARE DOING STUFF STOP
2247,Truth Runner,3.2,"14,794",Top Free,Casual,"November 12, 2021","The game is fun at first, but the notification are absolutely disgusting. In the questions they ask, you get more and more disturbing, I got a notification saying, are you gay, straight or bi, and there is so much ads your basically only watching ads"
2248,Truth Runner,3.2,"14,794",Top Free,Casual,"November 28, 2021","The ads are incredibly offensive, as many others have said. Your gender identity and sexuality are not defined by the clothes you wear or your interests. As well as there being ad after ad every game you play. This game is violently laggy, my phone can handle DRAGON RAJA PERFECTLY."
2249,Truth Runner,3.2,"14,794",Top Free,Casual,"December 23, 2021",It's a really fun game but there's a lot of ads. If there were less as then it would be a 5 star rating 🙂
2250,Truth Runner,3.2,"14,794",Top Free,Casual,"December 22, 2021",The game is fun BUT THE ADS ARE DEFINITELY NOT FOR KIDS. I'M GOING TO REPORT THIS GAME FOR SHOWING VERY VERY INAPPROPRIATE ADS TO CHILDREN. MY LITTLE 8 YEAR OLD SISTER LOVES THIS GAME BUT HAS TO WORRY ABOUT THE DISGUSTING ADS YOU PEOPLE PUT ON HERE. GET. RID. OF. THEM.
2251,Truth Runner,3.2,"14,794",Top Free,Casual,"November 28, 2021","It wasn't letting me move my character when I started playing, and when the first level finished it wouldn't let me move on. I would not recommend unless you like to have to wait for a terribly long time to play a game. 0/10 this game isn't as fun as it makes it sound."
2252,Truth Runner,3.2,"14,794",Top Free,Casual,"October 30, 2021","It's very glitchy, it won't let me finish a run without a ad, started to break my phone(moving the video from YouTube, kicking me out of the game, not letting me go back in) really hard to play because it won't let you move the character at first the it does it again later on."
2253,Truth Runner,3.2,"14,794",Top Free,Casual,"November 11, 2021","Literally. The. Worst. Game. So many ads! I played this game and every 5-10 seconds there was an ad, and after every level there was one. Terrible. If I could give this zero stars I would."
2254,State Connect: traffic control,3.1,"7,927",Top Free,Casual,"January 6, 2022",I did like it. Thanks to the update now I'm back on north America map. My percentages are where they been but map is empty and now I can't find the map to go to other areas. Basically all I can do is buy or watch clips to make my percentages go up. Will change rating when I can play again.
2255,State Connect: traffic control,3.1,"7,927",Top Free,Casual,"January 3, 2022","Absolutely terrible. No idle mode, game forces an ad down your throat every 30 seconds on top of needing to watch ads to get upgrades (which, from what I could tell, didn't do anything). Seemed like a good idea, but man was this a waste of time I will never get back. Would give 0 stars."
2256,State Connect: traffic control,3.1,"7,927",Top Free,Casual,"December 26, 2021",I have seen more ads than being able to play the game. I understand ads are important to pay for the updates but just too much. Game ought to be called how many ads did you just see. 2 stars is being friendly. Im going to uninstall this and may try again in the future to see if changes were made.
2257,State Connect: traffic control,3.1,"7,927",Top Free,Casual,"January 4, 2022","It's a good game but it doesn't idle when u leave the game, and it also just randomly reset the states. But I have 2 keys, still level 21 and 40m, and I can't access Europe either, and it's not letting me do anything so I'm going to have to redownload the app."
2258,State Connect: traffic control,3.1,"7,927",Top Free,Casual,"December 24, 2021","This game is a novel concept, nice and relaxed but there isn't much to it. There should really be idle earnings, and most of the upgrades didn't seem to make a change. There are also an insane amount of ads and to remove them is $5.50 which for this game is absolutely too expensive."
2259,State Connect: traffic control,3.1,"7,927",Top Free,Casual,"December 28, 2021","I don't know if it's just the Android version, but I try connecting the cities and a dotted line shows up and when I let go of the second City the line goes away and nothing else happens. The city's keep generating income and I'm able to upgrade the cities individually, but I cannot connect them."
2260,State Connect: traffic control,3.1,"7,927",Top Free,Casual,"January 3, 2022","DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! This game could have potential if they added idle time for when you're away from the app. ALSO, the ""travel time"" of the cars is absurd - it takes forever compared to the ads tbh. Usually I enjoy games like this but, honestly, this was horrid."
2261,State Connect: traffic control,3.1,"7,927",Top Free,Casual,"December 26, 2021","Fun game, if not for all the adds! They pop up WAY too often to really enjoy the game. It would also be nice to earn some money while idle rather than having to stare at the screen while the money slowly adds up, when your not watching adds..."
2262,State Connect: traffic control,3.1,"7,927",Top Free,Casual,"January 2, 2022","The game is alright but too many ads. I would play for 1 minute-- 45 seconds actually, and then get another ad. I understand ads are bound to occur but when it's to that extent I'm spending more time watching ads then playing the game."
2263,State Connect: traffic control,3.1,"7,927",Top Free,Casual,"January 4, 2022",I enjoyed the game and finished both continents however the most resent update doesn't let me play. When I open the app im put on north America and can't do anything. It says unlock for free on every part you can unlock but tapping it does nothing and I cant change which continent I want to play
2264,State Connect: traffic control,3.1,"7,927",Top Free,Casual,"December 22, 2021","The amount of ads in this thing is ridiculous. It makes it unplayable. I know the reason they do it is to get you to pay to remove ads. However, there is nothing engaging enough in this game to pay over 5 bucks for it. Removing right after this rating."
2265,State Connect: traffic control,3.1,"7,927",Top Free,Casual,"January 5, 2022","Game forces you to watch ads every 45 seconds. THAT'S NOT A JOKE EITHER!!!!!!!!!! Ads free game is priced at $5.50, which this game is not worth that price. Graphics, concept, and mechanic's are not at that level."
