Too many gimmicks now that clutter the screen so I can't even see. The odds of winning are lower and so is the excitement. I bet your profits are going down because of it? YOU need to make some changes before players just get fed up with you and leave. At this point I would never pay to play because I know I can't play very long much less win anything like in the years past. NOT FUN!!!(B2)Great fun when you hit big but that's usually about once every 6 months rest of the time you never get to play for more than 5 minutes without having to buy probably the worst ripoff app out there now(B3)I have decided to change my review. This app is one of the worst games I have ever played. The pay out is crummy. I play a lot of slot games and have never had to buy coins. I have bought literally hundreds of dollars worth of coins and lost them in a couple of hours. Even betting low so if you like throwing your money away this is the app for you. They should change the name to BS. Some of the slots kick you out and when you're on free spins and you lose it all. ????????(B4)Game glitches and lost my coins and they did nothing to fix it! How am I supposed to show a sceenshot after leaving the room and the amounts is different? Like I knew the amount would change.. I had 50 mill coins and didn't play anymore and I left the room and it showed 27 mill.. made a ticket and they did nothing about it! I'm deleting it!

2,Garena Free Fire - 4nniversary,Action,4,"Free Fire is the ultimate survival shooter game available on mobile. Each 10-minute game places you on a remote island where you are pit against 49 other players, all seeking survival. Players freely choose their starting point with their parachute, and aim to stay in the safe zone for as long as possible. Drive vehicles to explore the vast map, hide in the wild, or become invisible by proning under grass or rifts. Ambush, snipe, survive, there is only one goal: to survive and answer the call of duty.",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dts.freefireth,"G1)the fact is that this game is a very good game for low end phones. I have been playing it since past 1 week and have not experienced a single bug in the game. Something which makes it a perfect rival of pubg is that it has very good controls. I will surely suggest you this game(S1)I won't actually say about graphics and the connection here since I haven't played the game much actually , the thing is you've to work better on your animation to make it a bit faster , I mean like the players are slow , the weapons are , even those controls respond literally too slow , first of all—no tf actually you should literally increase the animation and make is a bit fast paced , it literally gets a lot of hate because of such problems(S2)The game is very nice but There is some mistake like 1) some times not croosing from window ?? 2) when we r landing from parachute that time we r land in under the land ?? very funny 3) some events is coming there we r wasting 5,6k diamonds ?? then also not getting that events 4) if new gun skin coming then u r dicreasing old gun skill power we note some time I thik u have to remove gun extra ability And we need nepal ???? server beacause ping problem is going on Please??(B1)I have many problems with this game 1:ping 999+issue 2:everything in this game is cost of diamonds and u have to pay real money for diamonds 3:hackers 4:fake damage 5:gliches like you will get damage even if you are in cover 6:you can't shoot while sitting in a vehicle 7:the matchmaking is too slow 8:many things you own need to be downloaded 9:sometimes while in a match my screen goes in the ground 10:this game lags alot 11:add more characters that we can buy with gold not diamonds plzz solve"

",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teenpatti.hd.gold,"(S1)it's amazing but many glitch in the CHATAI mode which was recently added even that mode still not appear on my friend's account who updated game at latest version, please make sure to sort them as soon as possible !(S2)Although it is interesting game but it have a drawback. Organisers are requested to made some modifications. Do not let join the higher end player to to lower slab table and vice versa. Once the slab is changed automatically shift the player to the higher slab table.Kindly do the required changes.(B1)Game is not fair enough. Its algorithm is biased. They are controlling card distribution. Also admins make one lose intentionally. It seems to be winning but at the end you are making me lose. It is happening all the time. Game admins are cheaters and fraudsters(B2)Have been playing since long now but out of nowhere it can't seem to find my account today! Haven't connected it to Facebook and the game isn't opening. Will change the rating if the issue gets fixed(B3)There is no point of using this waste application. Their algorithm is worst. one who wins always wins and get better cards. They are just scammers in all the ways. And the support guys are like hell. Dont have option for 0 star(B4)Full of bugs. They promise to give you chips for watching ads. Don't fall for it, it is lie. Each player get 40 seconds for one turn. Most of them take their own sweet time. You boringly wait for your turn. Suddenly, it reduces your chips balance. Crazy. I am uninstalling this stupid game."
4,Standoff 2,Action,4," The legendary ""Standoff"" is back in the form of a dynamic first-person shooter!
New maps, new types of weapons, new game modes are waiting for you in ths incredible action game, where terrorists and special forces going to engage the battle not for life, but to death.

The game is at the beta-testing stage at this moment:
- 6 maps
- 3 game modes (""Deathmatch"", ""Defuse the bomb"", ""Arms race"")
- Friends
- Lobbies
- Messaging
- Trades between players
- HUD and crosshair customization
- Text chat
- A lot of fun!",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.axlebolt.standoff2&showAllReviews=true,"G1)This game is so detailed. The graphics are like some sort of a realistic pc game graphics. It's the best fps game ever out there! The skins are so well detailed and the game gives you credits and gold too with a market. I suggest people who need a CS:GO Mobile game, then try this! Hats off to the devs for their hard work(S1)Its a wonderful game. I like this game very much. But things to be noticed 1. Gold: we should get gold by playing matches and by seing videos. 2. Glitch: there are too many glitches in this game in(sand yards, training outside, arena , village). The bullets pass thrown an obstacle. It should be removed. Hence, this is an excellent game ????. ????(S2)I love this game. Its super fun and it is the only fps game that I don't get bored. And the buy and sell skins is a good thing in this game. You can buy skin for cheap prices. But I have 1 request, please add 10 gold and 50 gold in top up so many people like me can afford to buy more skins in cheap prices.(B1)Game great but sometimes the controller is kinda hard like when l tried to pront and killed enemy suddenly my chracter start to look up and down,and it wasn't me ok,and its confuse to see which bom place on A or B and please add a new feature where -you can know where the bomb is when your teammate found it and it will say ""bomb is planted On A or B"". -add a skin video where if you watch 5 ads you can get free skin for free but have to draw of course. -last one please improve better rank.(B2)I played both critical ops and standoff 2 for long time. Both are great games. But there are 2 things I hate in standoff2. 1) Lag. Its been ever since the release. Enemy players teleport so much that it is so hard to snipe and knife someone. 2) Hitmarkers for wallbang. Hitmarkers are okay in an open fight, but in this game, you get hitmarkers even for wallbangs. Someone random guy will spam through a half meter thick wall and kill you because the hitmarkers will giveaway your position."
5,Lords Mobile: Tower Defense,Strategy,4,"The true Emperor has fallen. We need a real hero, a true Lord who can unite the Kingdoms. Recruit heroes from various backgrounds, from dwarves and mermaids to dark elves and steampunk robots, and assemble your army in this magical world! Fight and conquer to establish your empire!",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.igg.android.lordsmobile,"G1)I don't usually leave reviews, but when I do it's because the game is great. This game is one of the best mobile games I have ever played. It's fun and a good way to spend time. The free rewards are awesome, though one thing you can improve is having a better guide. Little arrows or display features would be nice to help locate things.(G2)The game is exciting and smart,you can learn a lot from this game,on this game you get to learn about strategies and lots more things.personaly I like to watch the fights, the graphics are cool too , everything looks realistic in this game it's like you're there but you are actually behind the screen it is a lot of fun .most people don't like it because it uses data but it is totally worth it because with this game you can escape your reality if for example you have something bothering you(S1)A couple of things to provide here.. 1: I really wouldn't call this a tower defense game at all. 2: Unless you spend $$$ everyone is going to pass you by in terms of might. 3: Those that have extremely high might will attack anyone, but mainly those that don't have a lot of might. 4: There are only 2 things really enjoyable with this game. The community and vergeway. 5: The developers should put a restriction on people with 1 billion might attacking someone with only 50 million or so.(B1)After playing it to 2 years, I can clearly say that, the game is designed to rob the pocket, If you can't invest money you can't grow, and loss in the game will give you heart attack type of pain and anger and also the depression, Packs are expensive, good material drop rate is null, you can't grow if you don't have money."
6,King of Avalon: Dominion,Strategy,4,"Raise your dragon and build your army in the PvP quest to lift Excalibur and become King. Taste power and victory while making friends and enemies along the way. Chat, help, trade, and wage war with players around the globe in a multiplayer adventure. King Arthur’s death has left an empty throne... Get ready to get medieval! The epic battle to conquer the kingdom with your dragon has started!",https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.funplus.kingofavalon,"G1)I have only been playing a short time , it's a great game , graphics are 100 %. Real Art of War game . With a great alliance you can upgrade fast and finish quests in plenty time . I would like to say that you should be able to attack while gathering resources and while you are in alliance buildings . Time well spent on this game I have learned alot . KOA IS AWESOME game just like to add there needs to be a language translator.(B1)Been playing for a while....glitches are costly and ridiculous. Badges are hard to come by unless you're willing to spend big bucks. Love my alliance they are the reason I continue to play. ""Cookie cutter"" responses to every issue is tiresome and irritating. Problems after every update.....just gets old folks. I understand this can't be perfect....but shouldn't we strive to make it a more enjoyable experience?(B2)I get that this is a war game. It's not right that you're attacked when not online or playing. That more powerful players can hit you constantly that you can not strike back cuz you're not equals in power. You never get to enjoy the experience yourself when constantly have to put all effort in shieldings/rebuilding making it impossible to grow or experience areas of game. Let alone making this game too expensive and stagnate forever stuck. A game is supposed to be fun.."
