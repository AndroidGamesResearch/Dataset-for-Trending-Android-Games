1,Coin Master,4.5,"6,516,241",Casual,"January 5, 2022","I really liked this game. I even spent actual money on it. Unfortunately I'm going to have to delete it because not only did they overcharge me ~$50, not give me anything for it and deny any refund. But now the game isn't even working properly.

10,Coin Master,4.5,"6,516,241",Casual,"January 2, 2022","The game is kind of fun at first. But 2 problems. 1st is all the pop ups.

Great design. 2nd issue is the card collection. Its...

12,Coin Master,4.5,"6,516,241",Casual,"January 4, 2022","I'm gonna be completely honest here. I LOVE this game, and on the purchases, you usually get a really good deal. HOWEVER, I get so frustrated because I also feel like they rip you off on certain things too. Thors wheel for one is ridiculously hard to get coins for unless you spend money and then you...

16,Coin Master,4.5,"6,516,241",Casual,"January 6, 2022","I absolutely love this game! It's fun and a good way to kill time. I think the only suggestion I have is that there should be some kind of ""idle"" option when spinning. Like things can be randomly chosen, and we don't have to press any buttons when putting it on auto spin. I'd love to just let the ga...

21,Coin Master,4.5,"6,516,241",Casual,"December 31, 2021","This game went from the best and most enjoyable game to the worst and least enjoyable game. Once you run out of spins you are done.

All the advertisements pop up. Go to here, buy this and get more spins, go to Facebook etc that's annoying"

43,Candy Crush Saga,4.6,"32,907,225",Casual,"January 5, 2022",I play every day. It helps with cognitive ability. It's fun to tackle the harder levels. It has great rewards and no ads. I like that it's progressive in difficulty but I can go back and do an easier level when I get low on lives.

45,Candy Crush Saga,4.6,"32,907,225",Casual,"January 4, 2022",Game is fun and time consuming. Paid ads are so annoying and pop up after almost every game. Trying to get you to buy in game features and single use items.

47,Candy Crush Saga,4.6,"32,907,225",Casual,"January 6, 2022","One of the few games of this genre that lets you truly advance without having to buy things. A player can move through the levels with strategy, wits, and fun - and replaying past levels is relaxing. Very enjoyable!"
48,Candy Crush Saga,4.6,"32,907,225",Casual,"January 6, 2022",I like Candy Crush Saga because it's a very fun game. I like that you get to choose if you want to view an ad or not. Who doesn't want free boosters that can help you win a game. The perfect way to use ads.

That's the point of alliance. This game also LITERALLY ""walks"" you through how to set up that as well though. Since my last rating the game has gained traction and was easier to understand and I enjoy spending m...

It was going to be a 5 star, however they keep pressing for you to buy resources and special items in the game. Some functions will only work after making a purchase. I'm trying to see if I can keep playing normally without spending anything on this game."

There is a good balance between rewards in the game anyone can achieve and specific boosts to address a facit of the game like time reduction, evolution, mutation, growth etc. It will keep a person bu...

And the sad part is that the devs will just comment.....sorry join discord and tell me there so I can ignore you in 2 places. 100+ reviews all saying pay to win. Last update.....more pay to win additions to leveling up ants. Don't wan't to ...

Update 12/21 The game has been reduced to limited slug fests with frilly mini-game add-ons. Game mechanic changes have removed any and all opportunities for player tactics in PvP. Can ...

Its such a nice community and a well thought out game. Originally I downloaded it to gain currency for a different app but it has become my favorite game."
3949,Design Home: Real Home Decor,4.2,"1,109,858",Simulation,"December 30, 2021",The gane is interesting in general. At first i thought you'd have to waste money buying gems inorder to upgrade or to speed up the building but to my surprise you can find gems by just playing the game. So far i am having a great time building up my ant army and i hope you' ll have fun too
3950,Design Home: Real Home Decor,4.2,"1,109,858",Simulation,"January 5, 2022","Its fun till lvl 6 or 7 when big bullies come.in and rake your stuff. A LOT OF ADS after level 5. Please dont leave these ""packs"" for sale all over my screen. I cant see to play the game! Also I would like to be able to zoom in and out a little more (when out in world especially)."

Most clans too afraid to attack another clan. Too hard to level orange that require duplicates and chances below 0.1%. There's a million things to pay for that would increase your progress onc...

Not even 5 min into this game the zone chat is full of bigotry, homophobia, racism, sexism and everything vile. Calling people every slur you can think of. I had to change the stupid language because I saw no option to turn off this ""zone chat"". Co...

My only complaint is that they are pretty pushy for advertising micro-transactions. It makes the HUD a bit cluttered on mobile."
3954,Design Home: Real Home Decor,4.2,"1,109,858",Simulation,"December 26, 2021","Love the game. Deleted and ended up getting it a 3rd time because it really is a great game. The graphics,the info. Usually stay away from games that encourage war and looting but it can be avoided often in this game. Give it a try, it might be worth your while"
3955,Design Home: Real Home Decor,4.2,"1,109,858",Simulation,"January 2, 2022","Changing this review to 1 star, because this game now SUCKS big time. Introduced an update, which even if people asked for, was made entirely to take more money out of people who can pay. Too sad, game with so much potential just being flushed down the toilet! I do NOT recommend joining game at this...

Its fun up to level 20, but you will need farms to progress further. Lots of clicking through menues trying to get to the right screen, and not enough variation."

High level players tend to attack low level players for resources to the point where recovery is almost impossible. What makes it worse is leveling up takes so much time and resources as it is.

It holds for a few days but then you understand that it's empty and can't give you any mind pleasure, it only steals your time. Do not recommend it."
