1,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 24, 2021",Good Game
2,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 8, 2021","Good. A bit laggy at times. Overall decent. Not the best to start on though. I would suggest console or PC first. Drains battery fast, and also takes a large amount of data if you play for a while. So I would definitely buy it if you want to, but don't start your minecraft career with it."
3,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 21, 2021","As minecraft grows older the memories I associate it with slowly fade out of relevancy. Although they will still hold a place in my heart, for being one of my first gaming experiences, for being the place I found my first friends, and for staying true to its original purpose. Fun."
4,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 19, 2021","I've always wanted to play minecraft, but all I had was an Xbox 360, and some probably know how old that minecraft version is. NO cats, horses, or multicolor beds! For the long run, I got the whole minecraft experience, I do despise the once in a while shake of the camera when I move it though."
5,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 8, 2021","I have been playing for almost 9.5 years, I love the game, but it took 10 years apparently to patch a bug. You used to be able to not get hit through blocks, now you can! If you do not put full walls and there is a 1 pixel gap in the opposite corner you will in fact get hit and possibly die."
6,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 5, 2021",This is so cool and the graphics (for being cubes)are great. And there is plenty of lore like herobrine. But I wish you could see old versions on the app itself. It takes some money but it's worth it.
7,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 22, 2021","I love this game. The possibilities are endless! You can build whatever you set your mind too. This blocky world is awesome! From fighting off the hostile mobs, mining in the deepest depths of the Earth, to building huge creations! I reccomend you get this app. You won't regret it."
8,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 14, 2021",I love the game. Ive had it for a few years now but idk why now but a day ago my co tries for moving and jumping have disappeared of the screen and its annoying. If anyone has had this happen to them and knows how to fix it please let me know. Besides that never had a issue and love the game.
9,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 4, 2021",I love Minecraft and play it often! The only issue I have is sometimes when I hit the jump button it doesn't work but that's really my only issue Otherwise I've had no issues and I love the new update! I definitely suggest minecraft to anyone who finds themselves bored often.
10,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 2, 2021",The best online and offline game on the planet + they are constantly adding really great updates so you can have a better experience in the game. From new blocks to new mobs it is the best game in the universe. I really recommend it for people that want to have new experiences.
11,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 23, 2021","I love this game, I always have. However the new caves and cliffs update has deleted all the mods I paid for. Along with my worlds. I've done everything the website said to get them back but it isn't work :( someone please tell me how to fix this. I would like my mods and worlds back"
12,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 23, 2021","I love building on this game and exploring and finding new things that I haven't seen yet (Don't play very much). Whenever I go to download random stuff, I have to update it even if I already did yesterday. But I love it, it cures my boredom when I got nothing to do."
13,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 7, 2021","Version 1.17 was amazing,But, I am making YouTube videos, And really need a camera toggle button, Please add one. However, Version 1.18 is a little more glitchy... Like, When I use boats, And get out, THEY DISSAPEARED! (Please fix that, Mojang.)"
14,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 23, 2021","It's super creative, and it's fun because you can join a friend's world. But... there are a lot of things that should be added; umbrellas, hedgehogs(ofc), pink fairy armadillos, other kinds of dogs, and actual moving cars."
15,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 1, 2021",Best btd game in a while would recommend the time and money spent to get the game. But don't buy anything after the purchase of the main game. Totally fun and doesn't take long to get advanced setups and have fun with the game. You can even create your own custom maps. Again totally recommend.
16,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 8, 2021","Great game. Would definitely recommend you can always expect new content and any play style can have a fun time, people looking for a long playtime or something to just play in the background, casual or hardcore. If you're debating whether to buy the game it is completely worth it :)"
17,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 3, 2021","A lot of different things to do, upgrade, unlock and it is overall a really good game. Lot of maps and monkeys and hero's and difficulties and just you can try a different strategy every single game,also there is no ads. It is just so fun to play"
18,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 11, 2021",Been so bogged down with the pay to play and ALL THE ADS. there are very few if any ads here and while there is still an aspect of pay for more features; it seems more fair. Other games you can easily spend over 100 dollars and your STILL scrambling to get anywhere. This game is great!
19,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 21, 2021","I think it is the perfect successor to btd5 with every good quality from that game put into this one and then more, it is such a fun game and has given me hours of fun, overall, this is truly an amazing game just showing what good games can look like"
20,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 21, 2021",I love the game and all the updates but it still has some issues in the multiplayer mode. It is still glitchy and has trouble getting into the game some times. My brother and I were going to play together but he is still waiting to get in.
21,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 24, 2021","For $.99 you can get the BEST tower defense game. You'd be a fool to pass up a 99 cent game like this, totally worth. I've gotten more play from a 99 cent game, than some of the games I own on steam. You can get this on steam too, BTW but it's like $10 so nah. This one is the way."
22,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 24, 2021","I love this game, except there's a problem with cooperation mode, the lag, getting kicked out, but mostly getting kicked out. It's not a complaint ,but really if you were to fix it I'd be happy."
23,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 17, 2021","One star because Co-op mode is practically unplayable because of serious lag issues. Will update if my experience changes... *Update 2021* issues have been fixed, and the new content added is AWESOME. This game is top 3 one of my favorites! Well worth the $5, and sometimes it goes on sale as well ;)"
24,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 19, 2021","Love the game, but for some reason when I try to play with one of my friends it says the game versions are incompatible. Other than that the game is amazing. The bloonchipper would be a great addition to the monkey crew."
25,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 9, 2021","Great game. It would be a whole lot better if you BT6 creators could put the Bloon chipper from Bloon Tower defense 5 on this game. If anyone doesn't understand what I'm saying, play Bloon tower defense 5, and you will understand what I'm talking about."
26,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 16, 2021","it's basically your normal tower defense game, BUT! WITH MONKEYS. besides that it's a very good game with working achievements and events and also good gameplay, it also has a save file feature for entering and exiting maps, maps are well designed as well. Good for a strategy game."
27,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 15, 2021",I base all other game reviews off this game. The entertainment for the price is incredible. The more you play the more in depth you can get with strategy and they just keep giving more!
28,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 1, 2021","Absolutely love it. Music, towers, POP sounds, but one thing. ADD. THE. BLOONCHIPPER! üêµ Good game, Co-op gamemode isn't your fault that the internet is bad. Very good game highly recommend playing. Happy holidays."
29,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 22, 2021","Semi-perfect game. Most of the players/ me would like to see maximum upgrades on all monkeys just like you did for the ""Boomerang monkey."" That's basically all that's wrong with the game in my opinion. Decent 4 out of 5."
30,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 12, 2021","easy to pick up, hard to master for a small, fun little monkey game, it gets challenging but the sandbox of it makes up for some of the impossible levels and builds you can make, ive got hundreds of hours"
31,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 10, 2021",Very nice time consuming game thats very easy but has the option to be very difficult in a matter of moments. spent hours just working on leveling up for my own entertainment. The only money I would spend on a mobile game again.
32,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 23, 2021","I love this game, its your basic tower defense but with so many maps. Not only that it also has multi player. If you like tower defense games this is a must have."
33,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 8, 2021",Coop is better. It looks like the person with the slowest device should be host and all others should set auto start to off. Screen record may be slowing it down. Time.Deltatime. Perform a ram test prior to match then autoswitch host
34,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 19, 2021","I have a very big problem with my acount, after the most recent update my acount has been reset hero's, monkey paths, monkey knowledge, monkey money, and all powerups. This is very irritating and it needs to be fixed!"
35,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 3, 2021",Love this game so much. The paragons add a fresh new play style. The only thing that I can think would make this better is secret agents from btd 5 or the bloon chipper. Can't wait for the next new boss bloon and next paragon. Also I wish the teir3 monkey bank would let you deposit money again.
36,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 21, 2021","Just purchased this game and tried to open it, instant crash. Just a black screen. Came to leave a review and I sorted all the reviews to my same device (S21 Ultra 5g) and apparently everyone is having the same issue since the last update. Will not rate this above a 1 until this problem is fixed."
37,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 3, 2021",I enjoy playing with my friends. But let me warn you if you're going to play online play then just don't. If you enjoy playing 75 percent of the game only to have it freeze and everyone stuck in limbo then be my guest. Fix this issue and it's 5 stars
38,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 15, 2021","It was 100% worth the investment. For a free app. At $5 it's not outrageously expensive or anything, but it feels like the price point creates a ""value vs investment"" internal debate..."
39,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 17, 2021","This game is so horribly rigged when verging the AI it doesn't even try to hide it, the dice roll is not by chance at all, every single roll every single game l you land on chance or non properties while the AI get double rolls on properties everytime, at least make it not looked rigged"
40,Minecraft,4.6,$7.49 Buy,Arcade,"December 19, 2021","""difficulty"" is basically just how much does the AI get given the roll it needs. DLC is insanely priced. Only buy it if you literally can play online or just do not care about a well designed game. Terrible."
41,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 14, 2021",Fun Game would like to know how the CPU is decided on the dice roll but overall a fun game to play brings back good memories when playing this as a kid.Update from 4 stars to 1 . I had to this game is more more based on luck then skill I wouldn't recommend spending money on this game.
42,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 14, 2021","The bots are at an unfair advantage! The game is very well made but, it's so unfair even on easy! Shouldn't have to struggle that hard when playing on easy! Bots and dice rolls are total garbage! Change the bot settings or I want my money back!!!"
43,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 12, 2021","Absolutely LOVE this game, but it has not been working for the past couple weeks. Uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times with no change. Keeps crashing on startup."
44,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 16, 2021",I've been unable to even get into the game for 3 weeks now. I've sent reports but have heard nothing and the game still crashes before I'm even in. Horrible game. I want my refund!
45,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 20, 2021","It's a good game but doesn't have the live video like the advertising says. Live video should be for all players at all times to make it more fun. So, this is just another regular Monopoly game."
46,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 13, 2021",Crashing constantly. Every time I put houses on my property the game freezes and I can't end my turn. We have to start a new game just for it to happen again. It's aggravating
47,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 24, 2021","Awesome, great boards to play with and pieces. Monopoly game has improved greatly since the last time I played. Great job on this app will always okay this for while to come."
48,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 15, 2021",It was working fine but stopped after the last update. Paid for the Winter Package too. It's been a few days and still no access. I want a refund if I can't open the app?!
49,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"July 27, 2020",The online part of the game is perfect. But playing singleplayer everything is rigged and there is no difference between the hard and easy difficulty bots. Stop lying to us atleast.
50,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 19, 2021","Ive had this game and played it on this phone before. But everytime i try to load it, it stops on the monopoly screen and freezes. Ive uninstalled twice cleared cache and date twice and it still will not load."
51,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 8, 2021",I've had this game for a year or 2 and had it rated 5 stars but all of a sudden the game won't open I click the icon and it'll go black and then back to my home screen. It's a shame I really liked this game.
52,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 14, 2021","Good when you can play. Ran in to a user ""Whatever"" who stalls the game if he doesn't get the trade he wants, maybe a child. No way to report the user or communicate what so ever. Would love vote to kick, report and avoid options for players like this."
53,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 9, 2021",I would of gave this five but it crashes in the middle of games with no reasoning at all makes me not want to play because you can be in the middle of a great game and boom just freezes and stops working
54,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 16, 2021","I can't believe how much this game crashes. I have been able to play 1 game, that's it. Now I can't even get back into the game...absolute waste. But, it was fun while I got to play! üôÑ"
55,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 20, 2021","Some players lollygag and have multiple accounts. This causes the game to be frustrating rather than fun. Sad part is, there's no way to report the behavior. Fix it & I'll adjust my rating."
56,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 18, 2021",App stops working soon as I open it. Have a feeling it has to do with the recent Android update. Edit: Game developer blames it on Android 12 and the S21. Maybe you just need to update your app?
57,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 16, 2021",I would have put a 5 stars but going to jail 4 times in a row is statistically impossible. Not sure what kind of algorithm is used but it is bad.
58,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 18, 2021",Game keeps crashing. I only got to play it once and after I got done and got back on it keeps crashing. Please fix your game.
59,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 9, 2021","Love all the options, the different maps, and the ability to play either by yourself or with other people. Totally worth the money!"
60,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 20, 2021","Was good until I went to open the game & it crashes. Eveytime since I ca t open the game at all & I've tried deleting & reinstalling the game, multiple times which didn't work."
61,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 15, 2021","Very charming little game. Lots of theme purchase options, but I'm enjoying just the classic look. 3D city is fun."
62,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 10, 2021","I wouldn't play this if it were free, too late now. Microtransactions for EVERYTHING and there's nothing random about the dice roll. 5mil you made off garbage.ü§Æ"
63,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 22, 2021",Worst game ever it lags pauses in the middle of the game it takes it so long for people to go the game was just stop I'm telling you I want my money back I need a refund I only played this game one time since I downloaded it I need help on how to get a refund from Google Play
64,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 13, 2021","I got the game and haven't been able to play a single game on it. EVERY SINGLE TIME I click start game, it crashes instantly."
65,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 9, 2021","Finally got to play after a week of the app continuous crashing, and it was worth the wait. Lots of fun and at a quick pace."
66,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 23, 2021",Love this game! I only wish there was some sort of reward system. Like ranks and how many wins and losses. Other than that I'm obsessed!
67,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 8, 2021",Bought it and for a week straight it has never worked. Turns on shows hasbro then turns off. Never had a chance to even play it. S21 Ultra
68,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 11, 2019",Great way to play! I always loved monopoly and now its great to play anytime I want. It is a very fun game!
69,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 16, 2021","Unplayable. Crashes during the loading screen, even after multiple updates. Please refund my money."
70,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 22, 2021","Game crashes Have an S21 Ultra. Game crashes at start up. I made to game start once, then crashed. It was 5* until now."
71,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 14, 2021","If you think its bad, YOUR WRONG because there is so much you can do, the community is so kind and nice, the levels are so fun and im happy this game is out. Thank you robtop and the whole game is so good, the build mode... makes the game have people. Everyone can wait until 2.2. We can do this."
72,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 14, 2021","This game is so unique! I LOVE IT! The rip-offs of this really suck, so this is the best one of those jumping-cube games, plus, if you don't wanna play the 21 main levels, play the endless online levels! And you can make your own levels using the level editor! Robtop, PLEASE MAKE 3.0!!!!!!"
73,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 8, 2021","Obviously one of the best games of our generation. With neverending fun, great music, and incredible surprises, Geometry Dash supplies you all of those elements. This is one of those games that actually requires skill and builds skill as you progess. Love it!"
74,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 21, 2021","Short little thing about this game, it's awesome, hard but fun, basically this game has everything you could ever want, except for one little problem, one day, when I went to play this game, all of my progress was gone! 5 stars --> 1 star | I am never playing this game again!"
75,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 12, 2021","This game is one of the best I have ever played. Great music, great levels. But when I try to select a custom song for my levels, the game keeps stopping for no reason. I would like you to fix that please, but other than that, this game is awesome."
76,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 10, 2021","This game is so addicting! Aside from the parts where I rage. This game is fun! The songs are original! The gameplay is fun!

After all, it is the biggest update we had since 2.0! Even though I know about 2.0, I have been playing since only June 7, 2017. Hope you like this review, and stay motivated!"
78,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 19, 2021","Love the songs, and game. The official levels are fun, and it's more fun to play other people's levels you may rage every now and then though. When you buy the game you have the entire game. It's not pay to win it takes skill and dedication (2.2 when)"
79,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 15, 2021","This game is very good, it is a great time killer. And ot is fun. You can customize your icon many ways and you have to do some work to do it. Once you finish a level you feel good that that level is good. 10/10 great game."
80,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 21, 2021","One of the best games i have ever played! Plus, it has absolutely no ads at all! The only problem is the time it takes to update. Sure, big updates are nice, but it would be better if you did a lot of small updates, that would be just as good!"
81,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 21, 2021","This is so fun! The levels may be hard, but their goals to work on! AND you can make your very own levels in this one!

82,Bloons TD 6,4.8,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 13, 2021",This game has been my favorite over the past years of playing.. this is definately worth the money. You can make your own levels an play your friend's levels. It is truly an awesome game to play.
83,MONOPOLY - Classic Board Game,4.3,$4.99 $2.49 Buy,Board,"December 21, 2021","this game is phenonamal! i love everything about it. the levels are great, i only have 1 left to beat, and the game is just great overall! a few bugs and quirks but the game is not really affected. also where is 2.2 robtop?!?"
84,MONOPOLY - Classic Board Game,4.3,$4.99 $2.49 Buy,Board,"October 7, 2021","I've had this game probably since release now, but there's an issue with the daily chest where it says ""something went wrong"" when I go to open it and I have no choice but to back out and wait for the timer to open it again without getting my rewards."
85,MONOPOLY - Classic Board Game,4.3,$4.99 $2.49 Buy,Board,"December 16, 2021","I love this game! I have it on PC, X box, and my Phone. I most likely have well over 200 hours in this game over all(dont hold me to that I really have no clue). Over all it's enertaning, and an amazing time waster that makes you feel like your accomplishing something. TLDR-its a good game"
86,MONOPOLY - Classic Board Game,4.3,$4.99 $2.49 Buy,Board,"December 24, 2021",This game is literally what I remember from the ps4 but mobile. Not only that but it doesn't require any network connection and that's not even the best part. It is SUPER battery efficient. I play this game and it doesn't murder my phone like other games. I absolutely love this üëç
87,MONOPOLY - Classic Board Game,4.3,$4.99 $2.49 Buy,Board,"November 10, 2021","This a really good port of the console/PC variant. Touch controls are okay. I wish they could be better. Playing with a controller, such as the Razer Kishi, makes this a very wholesome and fun experience. It's honestly one of the best games I've ever played and it's great that it's so accessible."
88,MONOPOLY - Classic Board Game,4.3,$4.99 $2.49 Buy,Board,"December 14, 2021","very fun. only downside is that it is less updated than the PC version, a huge letdown since mobile is easier to play on.. if the dev sees this, please consider updating the mobile version to the PC version. that is the only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars."
89,MONOPOLY - Classic Board Game,4.3,$4.99 $2.49 Buy,Board,"December 14, 2021","Fantastic story, gameplay and highly addictive. If you haven't played this gem already you are missing out.

197,Stardew Valley,4.7,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"October 25, 2021",It's cool because I like all the characters and you should add the security breach and uhhhh start working on it because I would be a fan of your work.

201,Stardew Valley,4.7,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"November 24, 2021",Let's be honest. We all just wanted PORTAL and not this. Port it to my phone minus the super fun (not) build a bridge and get rich(er) Seriously....... Portal meets anything would be better than this yawnfest.
202,Stardew Valley,4.7,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"December 8, 2021","Very authentic portal experience, and the portals themselves add a fun and interesting aspect to the tiny bridge game concept. Loving it so far!"
203,Stardew Valley,4.7,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"November 3, 2021","It's one of those bridge building games, but it's set in the portal universe, in aperture science labs. Fun, no major issues"
204,Stardew Valley,4.7,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"October 3, 2021",Very focused on its purpose of it's game title helpful tip's also very great on obstacle's excitement but also intriguing to the mind to learn but also understand ways of structures
205,Stardew Valley,4.7,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"December 11, 2021","Alright, this game is pretty cool. The real voice lines from Ellen McLain herself really makes me smile. Gameplay is good too, but the controls can certainly get annoying. Overall fun time. Good buy."

208,Stardew Valley,4.7,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"December 4, 2021",Love this game. Not easy but not impossible and you don't have to play to keep playing.
209,Stardew Valley,4.7,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"October 15, 2021",The controls are very frustrating. I'm having to delete and re-place bridge parts frequently due to placing them slightly off point. The function to move existing bridge parts usually doesn't work.
210,Stardew Valley,4.7,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"October 22, 2021","I already rated this game, i don't know why so many of my ratings don't save. But for this game, if you enjoy bridge construction games and loved the snarky comments and portals of the original Portal games, than you'll really enjoy this game for sure."
211,Stardew Valley,4.7,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"October 23, 2021",Love this game it's kind of hard at first but makes you really think and is quite enjoyable
212,Stardew Valley,4.7,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"October 3, 2021",Not as good of a bridge simulator as several dedicated bridge building games I have played but the portal aspect makes for a great puzzle game.
213,Stardew Valley,4.7,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"October 2, 2021",Very addicting and very nostalgic. This is an amazing way to carry on the portal games!
214,Stardew Valley,4.7,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"November 26, 2021",Worth it but please add a vibration feature when your bridge pieces are connected or aligned.
215,Stardew Valley,4.7,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"October 9, 2021","Good visual and sound design, but game is boring. It's not making you think, and harder level only means you will have to build more and more platforms instead of trying to come up with clever solutions."
216,Stardew Valley,4.7,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"December 9, 2021",The game has terrible controls. It's too hard to tell when you line pieces up

218,Five Nights at Freddy's,4.7,$2.99 Buy,Action,"November 25, 2021","One of the best games I've purchased. A very fun, challenging, and satisfying game. Highly reccomend. There have been more than a few levels I've gotten completely stuck on, and that's a good thing for a game like this."
219,Five Nights at Freddy's,4.7,$2.99 Buy,Action,"December 19, 2021","This game is a lot of fun. At first the levels are pretty easy, but they can make you think after level 16."

221,Five Nights at Freddy's,4.7,$2.99 Buy,Action,"December 17, 2021",I feel robbed. When i first purchased this game it played well with no note worthy issues. Now I can't even get the start page to stay up without the app crashing. Looking at other recent reviews I see I am not the only one having this issue. Either fix the issue or start issuing refunds.

I thought that maybe it just wouldn't happen to my phone but it did. Doesn't even open, and seeing as the last update hasn't been since 2019, don't download it. Not worth until an update comes by."
227,Five Nights at Freddy's,4.7,$2.99 Buy,Action,"December 16, 2021","Game will not launch after installing. It is literally unplayable. It crashes just as you open the game, before you even get to a loading screen or anything. Do not buy this game if you're on Android 12."

My son was so excited to play this game again after I purchased it a while back. Now it won't load. Pretty frustrating considering everyone has been having this problem and still nobody has done a thing about it
232,Five Nights at Freddy's,4.7,$2.99 Buy,Action,"July 4, 2021","This game is just fantastic! Even though the controls take a little while to get used to, and the graphics aren't the same as the PS2 & OG Xbox versions, it's still amazing to play a fully functional SA game in your own pocket!"
233,Five Nights at Freddy's,4.7,$2.99 Buy,Action,"December 22, 2021",Best DS for android. I've tried the others but they didn't have as many features or didn't run at the potential they should be running like they do with Drastic. Keep up the good work guys and I am always on the lookout for updates.
234,Five Nights at Freddy's,4.7,$2.99 Buy,Action,"December 15, 2021",It's the only emulator I know of where the audio holds up. Pretty much perfect. This is probably the most worthwhile 5 bucks I've spent on Google play.

243,Five Nights at Freddy's,4.7,$2.99 Buy,Action,"October 17, 2021","Absolutely worth the $5. Runs very smoothly, as opposed to more choppy free emus.

244,Five Nights at Freddy's,4.7,$2.99 Buy,Action,"December 16, 2021",Easily the coolest and most feature-rich emulator I know. I don't typically trust a lot of paid emulators since I'm from the FOSS world of doing things but I'm glad to say that I had nothing to worry about. It's well worth it.
245,Five Nights at Freddy's,4.7,$2.99 Buy,Action,"November 12, 2021","I've tried a few of the free emulators, and this one rides a Ferrari. The others I've tried are riddled with ads and seem to be poorly optimized or purposely slowed down. Can't wait to play some childhood classics"

The load and save States works. all the games I've downloaded from an Nintendo DS rom site works. It's smooth and easy to use. Looking forward to what else the developer has in the future.
250,Five Nights at Freddy's,4.7,$2.99 Buy,Action,"October 23, 2021",This was a good emulator but since Android screwed up the ability for emulators to read SD cards in the phones this app is completely useless! Paid for an app I can't use......

It would be nice if I could disable the in game volume on startup without muting my phone completely though.

260,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Adventure,"December 19, 2021",I have been waiting for FOREVER for this to be on mobile! Just like the original PC version. Not 5* because the UI is a little wonky and there are some relics that aren't working correctly.
261,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Adventure,"December 2, 2021","Awesome card game with tons of replay value! If you've been on the fence, you won't regret the purchase! It's a game you can pick up and put down easily (quick toilet sessions on work breaks ^^), but you can also spend an hour or more as well (without even noticing)."
262,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Adventure,"December 17, 2021","Excellent game, but the android implementation is garbage. The seed system does not work (it gives the incorrect seed code to your runs), the UI is very faulty, it's a battery drainer, and it takes forever to load. The actual game is fantastic and I would recommend playing it on PC via Steam."
263,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Adventure,"December 24, 2021",Game is amazing as it is on PC. Only reason I haven't given it a 5 star is because I've maxed out The Silent and completed/won a run and I still have 3 cards locked for her. Everywhere I've looked says it's a bug and I have had no success trying to resolve it.
264,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Adventure,"December 5, 2021",I love the game and jumped when I saw the game I had put 100's of hours in was on my phone.

267,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Adventure,"November 29, 2021","The original game is great, but this is a sloppy port. Card selection is sticky, so it's easy to select a card you didn't intend, and all the dialogs are clearly designed with a mouse in mind"
268,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Adventure,"November 27, 2021","My only real grip is the controls. Having to hold down onto every single part I want to remove gets really annoying. A button to enable ""removal mode"" which just removes whatever you want in a single tap instead of a hold, which you can toggle on and off on the corner of the screen would be awesome."
269,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Adventure,"December 7, 2021","Ive dreamed of this game for so long, and its so fantastic now thats its here! But.... It crashes so badly! If i build too fast, or get too close, build too big/complex, it all goes black. I want this to be good, but my situation is tragic."
270,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Adventure,"December 20, 2021","The game is fantastic for what it is but is most lacking in variety. You can only put down land and different color houses.

272,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Adventure,"December 13, 2021","Super cool, super fun... at first. I wish there was more to do though. I would love to spend more time in this world. It would be cool to start in the mountains or other terrain instead of only in the water."
273,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Adventure,"December 8, 2021",Quite relaxing! One problem: it is very annoying when you go to build something but it keeps deleting even though you're not holding your finger down. I have tried building floating areas and it keeps deleting. It's hard to get that build 'sweet spot'. It discourages my gameplay a little.
274,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Adventure,"November 2, 2021","I've had this game on PC and when I heard they were making a mobile version I was thrilled. This isn't a really a game, but an very engaging creative sandbox experience. It's calming and addictive. The devs have done a beautiful job."

278,Terraria,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Adventure,"December 3, 2021",This game is very nice. I would really love a first person view or something to wander the little (or gargantuan) town I made. Nonetheless it's very fun to play. I love it.

I like how it's like similar to fnaf 1 where the game randomizes when a animotronic come to get you, except it takes 6 minutes. Here you actually have to do something else in order to end the night.

312,Bad North: Jotunn Edition,4.4,$3.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 8, 2021",its fun to play but it gliches and shuts down. then you have to restart the intire thing sometimes. Edit : this only happens on the Chromebook version however on mobile it is Great. However that still effects my rating

315,Bad North: Jotunn Edition,4.4,$3.99 Buy,Strategy,"October 28, 2021",Really fun game if you buy all the boards. Each board is so unique and an excellent twist on the original board game. All the fun outfits and cars you can unlock. I really love it.
316,Bad North: Jotunn Edition,4.4,$3.99 Buy,Strategy,"October 28, 2021","If you play more than one game it will keep getting hung up, especially if you go into fast mode. Not a space issue or internet issue.... it's the game! Too frustrating"
317,Bad North: Jotunn Edition,4.4,$3.99 Buy,Strategy,"October 19, 2021",It's the game of life. It's fun. What it really needs is for the themes to impact the spaces you land on. Why am I going to a vr museum in the Dino theme or camping in the space them. Seems like the themes are all half-assed. You guys could make this game so much more.
318,Bad North: Jotunn Edition,4.4,$3.99 Buy,Strategy,"October 26, 2021","This game for what it is I would say is perfect.

320,Bad North: Jotunn Edition,4.4,$3.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 17, 2021",the game should be longer and have a more variety of game options when you play and land on the spaces. There is not enough life options and opportunities to win prizes. I mean this is supposed to be the game of life; well it's a pretty short game so far

342,Five Nights at Freddy's 2,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"November 26, 2021",This is not really the game of life more like the game of greed.

The difficulty is still there, although I don't feel it as sharply as I used to. All I want now is a full sequel or expansion. Maybe a level editor for PC?"
345,Five Nights at Freddy's 2,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"November 2, 2021",This game is fun if you are persistent can be frustrating because it requires you to scale up a mountain with just a hammer and pot. It also has poetry but it can be turn off as well as music. I like it alot so I suggest if you want a time killer and willing to spend 5$ for something fun
346,Five Nights at Freddy's 2,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 15, 2021","There isn't anything wrong with the game itself but there is no good sensitivity, if I do a circle around the guy, he tucks in the hammer and when the sensitivity is enough for him to go in a circle, its all he CAN do."
347,Five Nights at Freddy's 2,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"October 29, 2021","Great game. This game could really teach you some life lessons. My only problem is that theres not much to it besides climbing the mountain. Other than that, its awesome."

349,Five Nights at Freddy's 2,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"October 23, 2021","Controls are not properly integrated. The ""circle"" indicating your cursor aka finger frequently spazzes all over the place and makes the game far kore difficult than it is on PC. Still pretty fun."
350,Five Nights at Freddy's 2,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"November 8, 2021",Hard AF but amazing. This game is frustrating AF but THAT'S THE POINT! For all the low reviews telling you that this game is too hard or the controls suck don't listen. This game tells you that it's frustrating and to take breaks and it's right! It's a challenge so suck it up buttercup!
351,Five Nights at Freddy's 2,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"November 19, 2021","Great experience and hard as nails, though I think even for the point of the game being to be hard, the rock next the red metal platform is ridiculously slippery compared to the other rocks, making it a more unrealistically forced annoyance, but beside that it really is an awesome game."
352,Five Nights at Freddy's 2,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"November 30, 2021","Amazing, absolute masterpiece. So much detail and creative sections. Sure sometimes I would find the music annoying when I fell, but that just makes the whole experience better. Will play again."

Maybe that is the way its supposed to be, but making a game difficult because the controls suck is just annoying. Gave 2 starts because of the commentary during the game."
357,Five Nights at Freddy's 2,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"November 8, 2021",This game induces so much stress and frustration. Not recommended for those who have anger issues or little patience. I'd rather try to eat glass than play this game. I'm dead serious.

362,Five Nights at Freddy's 2,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"July 27, 2021",Good but hard to controll on touch screen. They should really add an option to play with a cotroller

I uninstalled this app because it was asking for some sketchy permissions including making and managing calls, email access, and pretty much anything you can give permission for. I understand access to storage but the others are a little suspect."
367,Five Nights at Freddy's 2,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"July 20, 2021",great emulator but has one huge issue. it demands access to all the Gmail accounts even if you have backups download in the settings and block internet access for the app. you can deny it but it pops back up an hour or so later no matter what.
368,Five Nights at Freddy's 2,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"September 17, 2021",Works good but it can't play the roms from the SD card. It only let's you get them from the internal storage sadly. Unless I'm wrong about that. I not sure where they be at because when I select SD card. It just shows the files from my phone and not the SD card.
369,Five Nights at Freddy's 2,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"August 24, 2021","This app is amazing! It perfectly emulates GBA (Game Boy Advance) games! And it's TOTALLY worth the price. As long as you have the game file on-hand, it works great! If you want to try it out, but don't want to pay, consider installing the lite version (it says 'free' in the title)"
370,Five Nights at Freddy's 2,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"October 27, 2021","Great app with lots of options, and the wireless multiplayer is great. Can tell you how many times I have lost data due to no auto save though. I would rate higher if there was auto save."
371,Five Nights at Freddy's 2,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"September 7, 2021",Had to buy the full version because it wouldn't let me use even a single save state contrary to what the emulator says. It wouldn't even let me go back to the auto save and kept saying that I was trying to use more then one save state. I would give no stars if possible.
372,Five Nights at Freddy's 2,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"September 12, 2021","Fantastic experience, well worth the couple bucks for the full version. I play pokemon all the time now!"
373,Five Nights at Freddy's 2,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"August 9, 2021",Would be 5 star but there is a lack of aestetics when using the app. Also I can't move my games to SD card? Why not? When I pay for something I expect all features.

572,Slay the Spire,4.7,$9.99 Buy,Card,"November 4, 2021","Good game, but I can't play with friends because apparently my version isn't updated and the store doesn't have an option to update. So I just can't play with friends"
573,Slay the Spire,4.7,$9.99 Buy,Card,"October 12, 2021",Its Exploding Kittens! One feature I'd like to see would be some way to play with friends offline. Via bluetooth or something similar.
574,Slay the Spire,4.7,$9.99 Buy,Card,"November 9, 2021",Good game really just missing a stats screen. Would love to see wins and losses vs strangers
575,Slay the Spire,4.7,$9.99 Buy,Card,"October 6, 2021",It is very fun. Just like the official card game you buy in the stores but hoping that more gets added in the future so it can become even better.
576,Slay the Spire,4.7,$9.99 Buy,Card,"December 18, 2021","So, I don't know why this is, but this doesn't work with the S Pen (and potentially other pens), and it would be amazing if it had support for that. But, other than that, it's a very well designed game, and I highly recommend it."
577,Slay the Spire,4.7,$9.99 Buy,Card,"November 13, 2021",I just bought the game and I can't even connect to public games. Literally so basic and you have to pay for everything even though I already paid 2 dollars.
578,Slay the Spire,4.7,$9.99 Buy,Card,"November 10, 2021",Fun game but it keeps glitching in multiplayer and making me take 3-4 turns in a row.
579,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"December 3, 2021",Nothing can really out do the actual game. The noises are loud and the game moves in a fast pace a lot which I don't really mind but with the fast pace is the constant sound effects that add chaos and even with rules the game seems unbalanced and chaotic.
580,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"December 7, 2021","even though you pay for the game it is full of in-app purchases which is crazy to me. its a little bit boring, too, which is not necessarily the game's fault. it ain't for me but it's not bad"
581,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"December 17, 2021",Just like the real life card game except A LOT more microtransactions. Not really play to win but there are the possibility for microtransactions on pretty much every screen.
582,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"November 27, 2021","Eh. It's not the same as the card game and the automated ""play with yourself"" difficulties definitely cheat to create the 'difficulty'."
583,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"December 17, 2021",Its a great game but I want to play using a controller. I would but the configuration on this controller is different so it would be nice if the app could detect the config of the controller (idk if its possible) and adjust so the inputs work correctly. Thanks.

585,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"December 17, 2021",I have been playing this game for 5 years i really love this game so much I have allmost all the maps but their is one thing I wish you guys would add multiplayer because sometimes my friends want to play true skate with me but I can't so please add multiplayer back
586,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"October 22, 2021",Really fun controller. I got super happy when I saw I could connect my ps5 controller and I tried to use it but evertime I presses R2 to set up for a trick it just changed the camera angle and didn't let me pop
587,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"December 8, 2021","Game crashes any time I try to open the menus. Otherwise it's perfect, but if I can't play your game then I can't give it a good score."
588,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"November 4, 2021","Been playing for years, and still love it every time I play. Pretty hard on carpal tunnel, but still worth the pain as I love skateboarding but never learned to ride one. Lol."
589,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"December 15, 2021",Paying 2 bucks doesn't get you the whole game. Just one map. The controls are wack. The physics aren't realistic like they claim. Touchgrind Skate is superior. And that's surprising
590,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"November 3, 2021","Sometimes is buggy, for the most part is good, wish everything didn't cost so much money but you gotta make money somehow."
591,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"November 3, 2021",Good game but there is so much bugs almost everything is paid coins are hard to get most missions are impossible mission guides keep going into walls that people cant get into its not worth paying 2 dollars for a buggy game
592,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"November 9, 2021",Fun skating game that has good graphics and different maps that you can either buy or save your coins by doing tricks.
593,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"October 20, 2021",I like it but we should get at least 1 more map for free with the game & sometimes it crashes and wont come on
594,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"December 9, 2021",I love the game it's perfect but the apk is not working with the new update if they fix that this game would be complete
595,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"November 7, 2021","Really good great game cool customization,tricks and maps the only bad thing is that you Technically have to buy everything with credit money that you have earned in real life but I got this game when it was free overall great game"
596,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"October 20, 2021",best skate game on mobile but maps are not free :( plus no iPhone transfer data to Android and very fun maybe needs online
597,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"October 22, 2021",This game is cool but something happened and I can't restore purchases and all my purchases are gone
598,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"October 21, 2021",Love the game for the most part except I bought the skate park 6 pack. Downloaded the maps then they immediately disappeared and it says I didn't purchase. Asked for a refund or the maps and so far nothing. I just want to skate those parks man!!!
599,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"December 23, 2021",The game play is fun but unlocking anything takes a ton of coins. If you want more than the first park you HAVE to pay real money. Wish I could rate higher but there's nothing keeping me playing I do a couple tricks and get bored because it feels like I'm not progressing at all.
600,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"November 3, 2021",Very fun everybody is complaining about how you have to pay for the maps but seriously the maps are very cheap once you buy some you can have a lot of fun in this game so I would recommend this game to anyone interested in a good skateboarding game for mobile devices
601,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"November 17, 2021","Today I bought a map called the ""warehouse"" and I'm not able to play it. I downloaded it and it keeps freezing when it gets to the amount of storage it takes. Please fix this or I want my money back!"
602,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"October 26, 2021","The game is pay to win, you need real life money to get different maps, and you have to buy most of the stuff, or just waste money to get coins to get create your board. Also you have to buy the game for 2 dollars, it's not even worth buying"
603,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"December 7, 2021",Good game great controls but it keeps adding coins to my inventory even though I did not buy them. I'm just worried it is charging me for coins I did not buy.
604,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"November 18, 2021",It's very fun and has great üëç quality and doesn't show no type of lags which is crazy bc all of the other ones I played it was super laggy and I didn't like it. But this is very fun I recommend trying!
605,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"November 24, 2021",Fix the mission there F ING impossible because they give no descriptions of how to move your fingers for the missions and please allow realistic mode for the missions!!! Please
606,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"October 26, 2021","Fun, but they milk you for money. There are very limited things included, and if you want ANYTHING more you have to pay. Coins are useless, as you need SO DAMN MANY to buy anything."
607,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"November 11, 2021",Guys your game is very good but can you add a backflip please and front flip that's why I give it four stars and if you add the backflip and front flip I will give you five stars I rate this a four and a half star I would do it if I could
608,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"October 25, 2021",I got this game like a year ago and I loved it there's no ads there's no glitches that delete everything and the game is fun to play without internet/wifi 5/5
609,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"November 7, 2021","Very fun although the prices are WAY to high u need to lower them by like 10,000 coins but its very addictive"
610,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"November 28, 2021",The game is fun but getting the controls take a little while to get a hang of
611,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"November 7, 2021","I love this game but I'm still have not got a skate park I paid for!? So,can I developer help me? But this game isn't really boring, its really fun and addicting! so download it thank you"
612,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"November 9, 2021",This is a great game but the reason its not a five star is because you have to pay for any new map
613,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"November 13, 2021","Terrible controls, tricks are missing or called dolphin flips, pay to play, point scoring robs you like SLS judges. DO NOT MAKE PURCHASES, they will take the money for nothing in return. Read reviews and tried it for myself, DO NOT MAKE PURCHASES."
614,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"December 6, 2021","Missing a map, restoring purchases doesn't work. I already contact support, but haven't heard anything all day."
615,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"November 1, 2021",Constant updates since release. The new physics system when enabled is very realistic and just shows how close this game is to competing with console Skatebosrfing games.
616,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"October 28, 2021","best skating game ever, went from flicking and hoping i land it to landing almost every trick and they look realistic"
617,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"November 3, 2021",Fun to play but add more features but keep up the good work on the game.
618,Townscaper,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Casual,"November 1, 2021","Good game, though i wish they would add more character customizations like more eyes, more lips, more hairstyles. Maybe body types. I dont like what selections they give us currently. That is really my only issue."
619,FNaF 6: Pizzeria Simulator,4.5,$2.99 Buy,Simulation,"December 11, 2021",Honestly this was easily worth the money. Came coming back to this game unlike my other mobile games i only played and installed for a week. I wish they would port the sequel as well.
620,FNaF 6: Pizzeria Simulator,4.5,$2.99 Buy,Simulation,"December 24, 2021","Overall a great game but the sound experience is just plain terrible I can't get off my monstie and walk at all without hearing the game sound stutter and lag out. This is really the only issue I have, so otherwise best game I've played in a while."
621,FNaF 6: Pizzeria Simulator,4.5,$2.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 29, 2021",The game is great and all but the battle mechanic I basically rock paper scissors like speed beats power beats tech and tech beats speed so you can see were I'm coming from but the game is excellent.
622,FNaF 6: Pizzeria Simulator,4.5,$2.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 4, 2021","Enjoyed the game though had trouble with a few things, basically the game closing if I put it in rest mode...or being kicked from a fight randomly..."
623,FNaF 6: Pizzeria Simulator,4.5,$2.99 Buy,Simulation,"December 12, 2021",Beautiful! I play on a cheap prepaid phone and have no issues! I would give 5 stars if it supported gameplay with a gamepad.
624,FNaF 6: Pizzeria Simulator,4.5,$2.99 Buy,Simulation,"December 15, 2021","One of my favorite games of all time, really enjoyed playing through it, highly recommend to anyone who enjoys monster collecting games and turn based jrpgs"
625,FNaF 6: Pizzeria Simulator,4.5,$2.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 26, 2021",It really fun but I'm stuck on this one level in the tunnel facing a kuhzu but other that that it great.
626,FNaF 6: Pizzeria Simulator,4.5,$2.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 28, 2021","The game is fun, and I'd play it more if the audio didn't glitch horribly. I tried lowering the heat thing but that made no difference so I have no idea. I hope they do something about this, cuz its making the game almost unplayable"
627,FNaF 6: Pizzeria Simulator,4.5,$2.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 21, 2021","Basically the full game with little changed. Fun story, engaging gameplay, huge post-game content. Great for kids, but I'm enjoying it too!"
628,FNaF 6: Pizzeria Simulator,4.5,$2.99 Buy,Simulation,"December 17, 2021",Audio randomly becomes muffled. Requires internet connection to play. Camera controls and auto follow are pretty awful for such a recent game. Navirou is the most obnoxious sidekick ever and you can't mute him. Decent game other than that.
629,FNaF 6: Pizzeria Simulator,4.5,$2.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 8, 2021",Only thing that could have made this better would be an English audio tracks.
630,FNaF 6: Pizzeria Simulator,4.5,$2.99 Buy,Simulation,"December 15, 2021","Wonderful JRPG, loved every minute of it. Worked surprisingly well on touch screen. $20 might seem steep, but just playing the main story I got around 40 hours out of it!"
631,FNaF 6: Pizzeria Simulator,4.5,$2.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 11, 2021","Performs really well. Much better than on 3DS. Very solid monster catching RPG with a similar gameplay loop to typical Monster Hunter. If you love AAA quality games on mobile, support this game!"
632,FNaF 6: Pizzeria Simulator,4.5,$2.99 Buy,Simulation,"July 28, 2021","Best Android game ever!! Ported over from 3DS, it runs perfectly. Well worth the $20 and the post-game is genuinely difficult (main game is pretty easy)."
633,FNaF 6: Pizzeria Simulator,4.5,$2.99 Buy,Simulation,"July 10, 2021",I regretted my purchase. The combat is far more tedious and unfulfilling than pokemon (which it's compared to as a selling point). I assume the sequels improved upon this but it cant be worth it to find out.
634,FNaF 6: Pizzeria Simulator,4.5,$2.99 Buy,Simulation,"December 4, 2021","I never thought I would play a mobile game for upwards of 40 hours, but this game is that good! It's fun, looks good, and doesn't feel like a port at all considering the original is a 3DS game."
635,FNaF 6: Pizzeria Simulator,4.5,$2.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 25, 2021",It's definitely worth it on mid to higher end phones if not the game is definitely gonna lag and eat up the battery but other than that it's simply amazing it's literally pokemon but with monster hunter üëå
636,FNaF 6: Pizzeria Simulator,4.5,$2.99 Buy,Simulation,"September 1, 2019","I got this game specifically because it was supposed to support a controller.

766,My Boy! - GBA Emulator,4.5,$4.99 Buy,Arcade,"December 3, 2021",This game is okay. It should be free since they make the heroes paid for. It's pretty lazy that the towers are just reskins of the kingdom rush towers but the hero system and new tier 4 towers are cool. The maps and enemies are also cool.

773,My Boy! - GBA Emulator,4.5,$4.99 Buy,Arcade,"July 3, 2021","Oooo and here comes the lore, the mini game/story caught me off guard, and so did how surprisingly easy night one was, only to be quickly jumpscared in night two, can't wait to find out what happens in the 4th game!"

777,My Boy! - GBA Emulator,4.5,$4.99 Buy,Arcade,"October 23, 2021","Good game, works fine. Only thing that can get annoying is that at the begining of the night the screen freezes for a few seconds then you can move"
778,My Boy! - GBA Emulator,4.5,$4.99 Buy,Arcade,"August 13, 2021",I think this game is pretty good with the movement and audio devices and I recommend this game if your looking for a scary looking experience
779,My Boy! - GBA Emulator,4.5,$4.99 Buy,Arcade,"October 31, 2021","It's a really fun game, and a great sequel to fnaf. Springtraps jumpscare isnt that scary, but over all it's a great game!"
780,My Boy! - GBA Emulator,4.5,$4.99 Buy,Arcade,"September 27, 2021","I love the game. It's much like the PC version and I enjoy it. The only issue I have is that my phone constantly vibrates when I open the maintenance panel while it has errors. I don't know how to fix it, but I don't see an options in this game like FNAF 2 and FNAF4."
781,My Boy! - GBA Emulator,4.5,$4.99 Buy,Arcade,"October 22, 2021","It was a good game and i love it but some glitches can ruin your run like when springtrap is on the opposite side of the building he can teleport to the door, he could also very rarely spawn right next to you there are more but this is all i can type ill keep looking for more. ; )"
782,My Boy! - GBA Emulator,4.5,$4.99 Buy,Arcade,"December 20, 2021","A lot of people say this is their least favorite game, but it's my favorite because of the atmosphere. The black and green, sort of glitchy and unstable atmosphere makes it feel so cool and scary. No problems currently with the mobile version, very cool and scary game. Challenging but not too hard"
783,My Boy! - GBA Emulator,4.5,$4.99 Buy,Arcade,"August 16, 2021","one of the greatest horror game franchises of all time. sure all the scares are jumpscares, but you really have to dig into the meat of this game which is the lore. the story is so complicated that people spend years trying to figure out the method to scotts madness."
784,My Boy! - GBA Emulator,4.5,$4.99 Buy,Arcade,"October 8, 2021",I have a few bugs. In the beginning of any night you can't move the screen. There is no options menu to remove vibration and shouldn't phantom BB jumpscare you only when you take off your monitor instead of doing it forcefully? Otherwise I like it.
785,My Boy! - GBA Emulator,4.5,$4.99 Buy,Arcade,"July 14, 2021","Five Nights At Freddys 3 is probably the least scariest game in FNAF. For 1., you don't need to worry about power. 2. Only springtrap can end your game. 3. Its easy to know when springtrap comes to jumpscare, since he stares at you first. Overall the game is fun, i like the style."

787,My Boy! - GBA Emulator,4.5,$4.99 Buy,Arcade,"November 23, 2021","One of the best mobile games I've played in a long time. Simple visual style and concept. Difficult to categorize, but it's a mix of real time strategy and simulation. Think a simplified version of Sim City, but sped up. Very addictive. Difficult to put down"
788,My Boy! - GBA Emulator,4.5,$4.99 Buy,Arcade,"September 2, 2021",Love this game. Talk about hours of fun and yet such a simple but amazing game.

789,My Boy! - GBA Emulator,4.5,$4.99 Buy,Arcade,"December 7, 2021","a nice and well-designed little game. More layers of complexity than what it looks like at first, there is definitely a learning curve on this one. Eventually got the sound back on, don't know what happened. Random factors make the game interesting but also sometimes frustrating. overall very good."
790,My Boy! - GBA Emulator,4.5,$4.99 Buy,Arcade,"September 23, 2021",Game is awesome and can be very difficult to get to more levels. It would be nice if game would change colors for levels that have it's challenges met.

792,My Boy! - GBA Emulator,4.5,$4.99 Buy,Arcade,"September 10, 2021","Perfect mobile game. Awesome presentation. Gameplay is easy to pick up, difficult to master. Plenty of replay value with different modes and maps. Excellent value, worth far more than the asking price."
793,My Boy! - GBA Emulator,4.5,$4.99 Buy,Arcade,"August 8, 2021","Interesting and innovative, but ultimately unforgiving. Takes half an hour to build up a successful map and a split second to bring it all down, which leads to frustration and an unwillingness to recreate an entire map."
794,My Boy! - GBA Emulator,4.5,$4.99 Buy,Arcade,"September 2, 2021","Great puzzle game, its challenging and fun to figure out how to solve an overcrowding problem, and the pause button is a lifesaver, 5 out of 5!"
795,My Boy! - GBA Emulator,4.5,$4.99 Buy,Arcade,"September 29, 2021","Perfect simple strategy game, where your progress is hindered only by the luck of the stage. While the rng is annoying it does give the game replayability so definitely worth getting and spending a few hours on."

797,My Boy! - GBA Emulator,4.5,$4.99 Buy,Arcade,"July 14, 2021","Amazing game! Equally the most relaxing and stressful strategy game I've played before. If I want to just chill out after a long day, this is one of my go to games. Lots of replayability too. Every map and replay plays out differently. Well worth the price.

812,Five Nights at Freddy's: SL,4.4,$2.99 Buy,Action,"July 13, 2021","Overall, this app is very confusing to use. There's no real tutorial segment, so you don't even get an explanation as to how everything works. Basically just Mini Motorway, but worse. If you have access to it, I recommend Mini Motorway 10x more than Mini Metro."
813,Five Nights at Freddy's: SL,4.4,$2.99 Buy,Action,"August 7, 2021","This game is fun, challenging, and addictive. It is one of my favorite games to play as a time waster or for a serious challenge. However having to leave a game with no way to save and continue is slightly annoying. Adding this function would definitely improve the game."
814,Five Nights at Freddy's: SL,4.4,$2.99 Buy,Action,"July 6, 2021",Really good game except for the fact that the train AI is a little wonky. An empty train with an extra carriage will completely ignore a station that is overcrowded. This has happened so many times and costed me so many games
815,Five Nights at Freddy's: SL,4.4,$2.99 Buy,Action,"November 27, 2021","I am really enjoying this game so far, have about 3/4 of the maps unlocked.

You guys nailed the Atmosphere. I'm hoping there could be little more content. This game runs sooo well on my Samsung S9. Nostalgia hits hard playing the old classics but in HD.

828,Five Nights at Freddy's: SL,4.4,$2.99 Buy,Action,"December 24, 2021","It's really good. Probably the best mainline FNaF game. My only problem with this port is that a good amoumt of the levels are missing.

832,Five Nights at Freddy's: SL,4.4,$2.99 Buy,Action,"August 1, 2021",Overall the game is excellent just like the PC version only downside is the controls as mentioned by others. Maybe add controller support or a way to connect mouse and keyboard to make the game a little more playable. Other than that love it!

845,Bloons TD 5,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"October 16, 2021","Fun game. Worth 3 bucks. Engaging fun and diverse. Like StarCraft. Good controls. Great mission length.

846,Bloons TD 5,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"October 7, 2021","Great game. An actual RTS for mobile! I think they did a great job keeping it simple for mobile, but keeping to the genre with research and unit production. Great job devs!"

848,Bloons TD 5,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 10, 2021","More than worth the price. Most optimized rts I've played on mobile. Yes, there is an option to purchase additional heroes, but you will do more than fine with what's provided.

849,Bloons TD 5,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"November 16, 2021","Perfect if multiplayer. (Because it's so good though, still giving it 5 stars) It's basically all that you would want in a mobile RTS. It's as if Starcraft had been made into a mobile game from scratch!"
850,Bloons TD 5,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 7, 2021",Throwback to some old games but with much more fluid graphics and gameplay. Fun story and a great game you can take with you anywhere. More games like this please.

854,Bloons TD 5,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"September 30, 2021","Although it is unlike what this company makes, it still brings the feel of tower defense to the table without it being a tower defense game."
855,Bloons TD 5,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"October 5, 2021","Everything Ironhide puts out is so good! Ive played all the Kingdom Rush games and was curious how the switch from tower defense to RTS would go, and they nailed it. Snappy gameplay, great art, fantastic sound!!"
856,Bloons TD 5,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"October 11, 2021",Love the game. RTS is probably my favorite genre and this is a fantastic casual version. Doesn't hurt it looks sort of like Warhammer and Alien with some Starship Troopers vibe.
857,Bloons TD 5,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"September 21, 2021","Decent RTS, easy controls. Gotten on play pass, so don't know how bad IAP is, but without them it feels fun and a good way to pass the time."
858,Bloons TD 5,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"October 5, 2021","Pretty fun actually. High replay value. Only gripe is the lack of free heroes, and the cost of the others, but also kind of understandable with how much game there actually is in here. Just could be cheaper, or have the bundle option always available, just in case."
859,Bloons TD 5,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"October 10, 2021","Good game, pay $3 one time and never have to watch dumb adds and no repeating same quest 1000 times to continue on."

862,Bloons TD 5,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"September 8, 2021","5 star game, countless hours spent on ironhide games. Only complaint is the hero costs, maybe a bundle to get them all for a cheaper price to solve that? but amazing game in literally every other aspect. The references to other scifi movies and such are hilarious just as a last note."
863,Bloons TD 5,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"September 11, 2021",This game has fantastic artwork and the gameplay is well designed. My only gripes are that the game lacks skirmish and multiplayer modes.
864,Bloons TD 5,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"September 14, 2021",Tons of levels and bonus challenge levels. Lots of heros but you have to buy a lot of them. Pretty sizable upgrade tree that's pretty fun to progress with. Over all I think it's definitely worth it.
865,Bloons TD 5,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"September 21, 2021",I love their other tower defense games. This is a bit different though. Its like their old style had a baby with Starcraft. This will become very clear when playing. Its very enjoyable.

867,Bloons TD 5,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"September 9, 2021",Really fun. I wish it had more building reliance and allows us to play where buildings go like a true RTS. Also a save game feature. Its mobile and has even more likely you'll have to unexpectedly put the game down.
868,Bloons TD 5,4.6,$2.99 Buy,Strategy,"September 4, 2021",Was really excited for a mobile RTS but at the start you were really limited in what you could do. It was a very linear experience and I didn't want to play for more than an hour

I'd never played the 2.6 version before and was skeptical of the decision to put resources into launching the old version. This is a much cleaner game. Works well on multiple Android devices.

975,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Puzzle,"October 1, 2021",Please stop complaining about the cost of this game.

994,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Puzzle,"October 23, 2021","Such a cool idea but now that it has been imitated to death it's interesting to go back to the original and see how it holds up.

995,The Room,4.8,$0.99 Buy,Puzzle,"December 22, 2021",Wonderful but short. Well worth a few bucks. The puzzles weren't chellenging but the craftsmanship was superb.

1044,Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition,3.9,$9.99 $1.99 Buy,Role Playing,"December 22, 2021",Edit: The 1 ‚≠ê review is a result of making a bad game.

1169,True Skate,4.3,$1.99 Buy,Sports,"November 28, 2021","I absolutely love the Kingdom Rush games. This one is fantasy themed, reminiscent of lord of the rings. There is good strategy, good challenge, and lots of replay value. Well worth the time and money."

I refunded however since my Razor Kishi is not supported even though it detects the right button press for coop?? I feel like controller support on mobile would tie up the bow on a already great game.
1188,Monster Hunter Stories,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"August 5, 2021",A truly beautiful and we'll made game! The music and atmosphere is very relaxing but at some points stressful. Very good game for the money.

1190,Monster Hunter Stories,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"August 17, 2021","It is a good game, and a great sequel, though I did refund for it was too laggy for my device. The first one never lagged, so I'm assuming it's because this one has many more assets. I will reinstall it but that's only if the performance ends up better. Other than that though great game! I love it!"
1191,Monster Hunter Stories,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"November 17, 2021","Nigh perfect! Customizable control schemes. Still, it's a pity that I can't activate the classic cheats, for old times sake! Even so, this version will run circles on the ""Definitive Edition"", any day!"
1192,Monster Hunter Stories,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"July 2, 2021",It's literally the only grand theft auto game that works on mobile. The frame rate is not the best but hey can't complain with the price the story is good among the best (in my opinion) hours and hours of time too kill with it. Great game (PLEASE UPDATE SAN ANDREAS APP WILL NOT LOAD)
1193,Monster Hunter Stories,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"October 1, 2021",This is an excellent port of the game. The controls camera is a little goofy sometimes but that's just how games were back then. I'm still trying to figure out how to aim the guns.
1194,Monster Hunter Stories,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"August 18, 2021","This and the other two are the original games, not the definitive edition versions.

1195,Monster Hunter Stories,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"December 4, 2021","This game was my childhood and I finished it again. Everytime I play it, it's like I'm playing it for the first time but this game has its own shares of bugs but overall this game is a masterpiece."

So other players good luck
1199,Monster Hunter Stories,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"December 23, 2021",Fantastic game that plays very well on my phone and tablet. I really hope when the remastered version comes out that you will offer an upgrade price for the new version instead of making current owners pay full price. One can dream
1200,Monster Hunter Stories,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"July 27, 2021","Its ok, however if the game had the combat mechanics of GTA SAN ANDREAS as well as the customization mechanics of GTA San Andreas the game would probably be better... also i was originally going to put 4 and a half stars, but apparently you can't put 4 and a half stars."
1201,Monster Hunter Stories,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"July 10, 2021",Best game ever. Don't not delete this game if it's having problems for you. This game is incredible. it let's you do missions and you can drive around and steals car and maybe ever let you rob banks. dont dlete this game.

1203,Monster Hunter Stories,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"October 23, 2018","A bare minimum port. Default Xinput settings are wrong, and there is no option to fix it. Pretty much unplayable on a touchscreen or controller. Game runs flawlessly on my Galaxy Halo. Such a bummer."
1204,Monster Hunter Stories,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"July 21, 2021",It has good graphics and is overall a great game but it is a very difficult game sometimes but all games are not perfect
1205,Monster Hunter Stories,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"May 6, 2020",It's decent compared to the original on ps2. Looks good on galaxy note 9 and stylis can be used and controls can be relocated on the screen

Not the greatest graphics but it sure has a good storyline. Always played it on the PlayStation 2 years ago, but its still the same as it was years ago. Definetly a good buy."
1208,Monster Hunter Stories,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"October 5, 2019",Game is overall pretty fun but has some flaws that stopped me from giving 5 stars. The controls are very bad at precision. For example one mission requires you to throw a grenade through a window and that took me several attempts since it was hard to line up. Still a decent game overall
1209,Monster Hunter Stories,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"September 26, 2018",I am amazed at how well this runs and plays on mobile using touch controls. And I did not realized it was enhanced on here for the 10yr anniversary. I know the definitive editions just came out but this is perfect I'm the go. Good job Rockstar! Now give me The Warriors please LoL

1213,Monster Hunter Stories,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"October 24, 2018","A very fun game. Story is fairly good so far. But, like others have said, the cars are pretty hard to control sometimes. I'm stuck on a racing level because of how slippery the car drives. But other than that, pretty good!"

1216,Monster Hunter Stories,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"October 27, 2018","Boring, hard to control and the story isn't exactly the most engaging, but it WAS made in 2001 so I'll give it a little bit of slack. Plus this game was very influential in gaming with its open world exploration."
1217,Monster Hunter Stories,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"October 3, 2018",Gta 3 definitely is a good game : things I like i like the aiming its way better on mobile. The driving's nice. :things I dislike. trajectory the trajectory is bad like Sam where you have hit the rocket perfectly. The m 16 in the hands of npc if they have your going to die.
1218,Monster Hunter Stories,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"October 15, 2018",Fantastic. In 2001 it was my favorite. And in 2021 its still my favorite. Could you just update the map on the gameplay? Just make it a little easier to read? I'm a huge fanatic of the GTA franchise. You guys need to put GTA 2 on the playstore.
1219,Monster Hunter Stories,4.6,$4.99 Buy,Role Playing,"October 15, 2018",I love this game so much but only if u can fix the controls and a little bit more graphics

1224,Graveyard Keeper,4.2,$9.99 $2.99 Buy,Role Playing,"September 28, 2021",I loved this game on console and this port is near flawless! It can be rough but with practice makes perfect.

1225,Graveyard Keeper,4.2,$9.99 $2.99 Buy,Role Playing,"December 1, 2021","Love the game, I also play it on PC. The mobile version runs smooth/fast for me only in the first level but runs drastically slower when I get to the promenade. 3 stars just cause the lag makes progression difficult. Makes me wish I had more control over the graphics settings."
1226,Graveyard Keeper,4.2,$9.99 $2.99 Buy,Role Playing,"November 25, 2021","Just amazing. Reminds me of Demon Hunter: Return of the Wings (RIP that masterpiece), Castlevania: SotN, and a Soulsborne title.

This will always be hands down, one of my favorite games to play on mobile( I will say though, I wish the boundaries for moving the buttons around was a bit more free).

1241,Graveyard Keeper,4.2,$9.99 $2.99 Buy,Role Playing,"August 30, 2021",Pretty good so far but there seems to be a bug where you get a notification on your screen and it won't let your out unless you restart the game but should you be as unlucky as I was you'll have to restart your good run because it keeps appearing even if you restart EVERYTHING.
1242,Graveyard Keeper,4.2,$9.99 $2.99 Buy,Role Playing,"August 25, 2021",One of the best offline games i've played in a while tho a bit expensive when it comes to the DLC's they are worth it.

The only thing I think is wrong is every time I get over 10 points, and get the ball I get double or triple teamed which takes away some of the fun of ISO, but overall a very good game."

1476,Five Nights at Freddy's 3,4.5,$2.99 Buy,Action,"March 30, 2019",Frustrating controls. You can click on something several times before it does what you want. Then you're out of time and have to start over.

Not only that but my brother deleted the game, I've been trying to download it ever since. It's letting me review it but either I want to be allowed to play it or at least refund me. That was a good 4 dollars."
1485,Five Nights at Freddy's 3,4.5,$2.99 Buy,Action,"July 1, 2019","The game is awesome, in the beginning though it's extremely hard to move as the character keeps rubber banding and making it pretty hard to move over or even around objects."
1486,Five Nights at Freddy's 3,4.5,$2.99 Buy,Action,"April 17, 2020",Control are very uncomfortable and hard. They should make another button for grab instead of place grab with control. I deleted and refunded because control was trash in the phone.

1490,Five Nights at Freddy's 3,4.5,$2.99 Buy,Action,"September 4, 2020",Fun game but I have to agree with others when mentioning the beginning when you're tasked with scavenging. It feels broken.
1491,Mini Metro,4.6,$0.99 Buy,Simulation,"December 19, 2021","The game is very different after all these years. The questions are not well curated, and there are far too many microtransactions pushed on you, even in the premium version."

1495,Mini Metro,4.6,$0.99 Buy,Simulation,"October 21, 2021","""No Ads"" is an absolute lie. Constant ads. And the ""spend premium currency"" button when you get a question wrong is in the same place as the ""continue"" button. Clearly more concerned with money than happy returning players."

1498,Mini Metro,4.6,$0.99 Buy,Simulation,"October 24, 2021",I have played this game for a long time and enjoyed it. The card machines haven't been updated in a long time. It would be nice to have new machines and maybe add cookies to feed your animal to collect.
1499,Mini Metro,4.6,$0.99 Buy,Simulation,"October 30, 2021",I pay for the add free version and still get adds out the wazoo. There is no difference. Do not buy the premium version.
1500,Mini Metro,4.6,$0.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 19, 2021",It's great. I live survival mode. I have the paid version. Couple of feedback items: the continue/ play button should be more prominent. And many of the questions have odd grammatical construction.
1501,Mini Metro,4.6,$0.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 21, 2021","Despite paying for a premium, supposedly ad-free game, they bombard you with the same ""special"" offers multiple times over after every turn. So many pop ups."

1507,Mini Metro,4.6,$0.99 Buy,Simulation,"December 5, 2021","This game is unplayable. There is no button to hold down mist form, so you are unable to progress past the gate to get form of bat. Even with a Bluetooth controller you are only able to transform into the wolf. Seems like the game was released before it was fully tested"
1508,Mini Metro,4.6,$0.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 26, 2021",Touchscreen controls take getting used to but it's one of the best games ever. One gripe is that the librarian bestiary drop list is full immediately. Completing that on your own was part of the fun.
1509,Mini Metro,4.6,$0.99 Buy,Simulation,"October 29, 2021","Good game, runs very well for the most part. I don't like that the gamepad isn't adjustable, and the auto save feature ruined an incomplete 8+ hour playthrough by saving my game in an inescapable spot that I glitched into."
1510,Mini Metro,4.6,$0.99 Buy,Simulation,"October 25, 2021","The touch screen controls are not good, but once you pair a bluetooth controller with your mobile device, the game is fantastic. A great port for the best Metroidvania ever."
1511,Mini Metro,4.6,$0.99 Buy,Simulation,"September 9, 2021","There needs to be a way to move the action buttons. I naturally reach a bit farther on the screen when attacking, and end up doing nothing instead. Simply being able to adjust the location per individual would make the game much more playable."
1512,Mini Metro,4.6,$0.99 Buy,Simulation,"December 2, 2021",The button layout makes the game difficult to play. It can't be changed and most buttons are too small and too finicky. Miss the attack button by even a millimeter and it won't happen.
1513,Mini Metro,4.6,$0.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 5, 2021","It's awkward to play on a Samsung 21S. It would be nice if we could remap the controls, because it feels like the jump button is too close to my hand. It makes jumping hard, especially if I'm trying to jump and either move or attack"

1515,Mini Metro,4.6,$0.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 9, 2021",Really fun. Playable without a controller but it takes a LONG time to get used to and the dpad combos are really difficult to reliably and repeatedly pull off. But the app is also controller compatible so if you have one you'll be fine
1516,Mini Metro,4.6,$0.99 Buy,Simulation,"September 7, 2021","I have to give this 3 stars. Only because, after 30 years (not exactly) why has this game got a fresh coat of paint? Konami, you suck! Quit bleeding this game out like this. In fact the damn franchise is being mishandled. Give it someone with some willingness to do at least a simple update."

1518,Mini Metro,4.6,$0.99 Buy,Simulation,"September 24, 2021","Is a solid game so far, my only issue is the lack of button mapping for the skills like the OG had. If they implement that I'd put it at 5 star. Other then that solid game."
1519,Mini Metro,4.6,$0.99 Buy,Simulation,"September 11, 2021","You cannot move or resize the horrible touch screen controls. Jump button is placed too low on the screen, forcing me to bend my right thumb awkwardly to play. Attack button is too small and hard to register consistently."
1520,Mini Metro,4.6,$0.99 Buy,Simulation,"September 13, 2021","Overall this game is great. Controls are fine, music is fine, it's a decent port. I do have a problem in that one day it stopped working and I can't play ever since."

1522,Mini Metro,4.6,$0.99 Buy,Simulation,"August 18, 2021",The game wasn't bad about the same as the original with a few minor differences but what I can't stand is the voice overs and how they changed the commentary it just makes it so annoying
1523,Mini Metro,4.6,$0.99 Buy,Simulation,"July 14, 2021","Great port of SotN, controls are iffy but there are shortcuts for the special moves that makes using them a lot easier!"
1524,Mini Metro,4.6,$0.99 Buy,Simulation,"July 26, 2021",Very engaging and challenging! The hints are great. I try not to use them but it's nice to have them if you really get stuck. It's addictive and hard to put down. I found myself wanting to solve puzzle after puzzle and would lose track of the time.
1525,Mini Metro,4.6,$0.99 Buy,Simulation,"August 2, 2021","Very fun puzzle game, I would suggest playing the other 3 first. All are very fun games that you can solve without hints if you look hard enough. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who enjoys solving things."

1529,Mini Metro,4.6,$0.99 Buy,Simulation,"August 23, 2021",Seriously enjoyed this game. The puzzles were great and the story honestly lends itself to more questions than answers (which is perfect for a dark mystery yet to be solved).

1533,Five Nights at Freddy's: HW,3.8,$4.99 Buy,Action,"December 22, 2021","This game must be played on tablets than phones due to the small text size.

1563,Five Nights at Freddy's: HW,3.8,$4.99 Buy,Action,"December 4, 2021","Poor control scheme. Simple action specific buttons are plenty for a mobile game, the mobile market isn't advanced enough to attempt innovation in the department mobile game controls."
1564,Five Nights at Freddy's: HW,3.8,$4.99 Buy,Action,"December 20, 2021",Very good! But i honestly think it gets way to hard with the constent seages at the end usually it ends up with their hardly being anyone left due to a lack of general medicine or food. Or even weapons

It's challenging but not impossible, and you get so many different playthroughs out of it, it's 100% worth downloading.

It takes a little bit to get used to the controls, but they are pretty intuitive when you do. I highly recommend turning off the auto triangle function and building your own.

1669,Pocket City,4.4,$2.99 Buy,Simulation,"September 27, 2021",Its a fun game. Very challenging. But the controls seem a little unintuitive. I wish it snapped to a graph a little more instead of being so free hand when you draw. Makes it seemingly impossible to make things even and nice looking without putting in a ton of work.
1670,Pocket City,4.4,$2.99 Buy,Simulation,"October 24, 2021","Great fun game. Build bridges, some of which aren't really bridges, and watch the vehicles use them to get where they need to go, or fail hilariously."

You can legitimately get further by random swiping than you can trying to evaluate your choices. Bunch of random deaths that are not foreseeable or preventable. The combat is random and awful.

1906,Kingdom Rush Vengeance TD Game,4.6,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 11, 2021","The game is really fun, only downside is when I uninstalled for a bit I lost all of my progress and in app purchases, but other than that the game is pretty fun."
1907,Kingdom Rush Vengeance TD Game,4.6,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 22, 2021",I love this game because you can take orders and it is so much fun playing this game and there are lots of more Papa Ria's games you can do pancakes you can do with sandwich one and those games are also fun best game that ever existed I'll probably break this 105
1908,Kingdom Rush Vengeance TD Game,4.6,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 21, 2021","Out of all the games in the series, this one is, by far, the most difficult. I'm on Day 9 and I've only scored above an 89 twice. Once was during the tutorial! Even after finally being able to purchase the cooking alarms, my waiting scores are abysmal. Please, do something to adjust the difficulty."
1909,Kingdom Rush Vengeance TD Game,4.6,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 17, 2021","I love this game! I've been waiting for a new game to come out, and I'm glad it's Sushiria this time. Sure, the game is more challenging at first, but it's challenging in a fun way! It gets more easier as you get used to it. I highly recommend it."
1910,Kingdom Rush Vengeance TD Game,4.6,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"November 22, 2021",It's even better than the flash game! But I do have one issue where when I'm scroll through the sauces and stuff where it suddenly starts putting the sauce/topping on the sushi roll even though my finger is still on the sauce/topping itself.
1911,Kingdom Rush Vengeance TD Game,4.6,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"November 23, 2021","It's high quality and fun like all Papa Louie games. Biggest gripe for me is the bubble tea, which is based on pushing the button with right timing. Takes a while to get decent at."
1912,Kingdom Rush Vengeance TD Game,4.6,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 1, 2021",A cut above the average cooking time-management game. Challenging and always changing with seasonal ingredients. Lots of costume options you can get without real money.
1913,Kingdom Rush Vengeance TD Game,4.6,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 1, 2021",A more polished version of the PC one and I'm loving it. There's no food game that does it with the same quality like Flipline Studios.
1914,Kingdom Rush Vengeance TD Game,4.6,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"November 25, 2021","I like the Design of the Game, But Im a Fan of quick games, the recent flipline studio games have been getting for complex and harder lately so a 4 out of 5 for me,"

1920,Kingdom Rush Vengeance TD Game,4.6,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"October 29, 2021","Way to complicated. Buttons way to touchy, other controls are way to easily mistaken and yea.. Not great. Sorry.... I loved the papa's burgers.. But this is way overboard."
1921,Kingdom Rush Vengeance TD Game,4.6,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 18, 2021",Love how the game has been adapted to mobile. Fun to play. But can't save the profile in case I change phones or reset so 3/5.

As an old school EV, EVO, EV Nova player it is hard to find games that closely scratch that particular itch, but this series does. It's most similar to EV Nova.

1929,Kingdom Rush Vengeance TD Game,4.6,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"October 5, 2021","Overall great game, I like the fleet mechanics and the derelict ships that you can find, my only complaints so far is that the game crashes when pressing on the arena quest(only for the special arena match I think) and crashes when you fail and touch the finish line for the FER training."
1930,Kingdom Rush Vengeance TD Game,4.6,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"October 5, 2021","Absolutely fantastic! I loved Space RPG 3 and this is rapidly becoming my favorite one. I'm not very far into the game, but I'm hoping there are more player faction related content."
1931,Kingdom Rush Vengeance TD Game,4.6,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"October 30, 2021",So far it will not boot up. Crashes everytime.

1932,Kingdom Rush Vengeance TD Game,4.6,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"November 18, 2021",I have followed this game series since the first game and l love seeing improvements.

1933,Kingdom Rush Vengeance TD Game,4.6,$4.99 $2.99 Buy,Strategy,"December 18, 2021","If you played space RPG 3 you know what to expect, this game has the same principals and systems with a few extra like an improved escort system and fuel along with a diffrent story line.

1948,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"December 20, 2021",Worth the wait!
1949,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 25, 2021",Perfect early Christmas present. I found holden here's to hoping some mission has him in it. Also was wondering if you could reduce damage to fleet ships from ion storm really nukes my fleet any time I have to go through one.
1950,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"December 8, 2021","A great game, I personally recommend this for people who enjoys mainly about the wonders of space travel, trading, ship battles, and faction conflicts. It's like starsector but lite version. The rpg series never failed to make me bored."
1951,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"October 29, 2021",Very happy glad to see this game came out. As someone said. As close to starsector as you can get on the phone
1952,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 25, 2021","Great christmas gift. A worth of wait for years, finally another masterpiece from the series of space rpg."
1953,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 11, 2021",Long waited masterpiece. Thank you so much for releasing. I've been waiting too long...
1954,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"December 9, 2021","Basically a better, mobile Elite Dangerous."
1955,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 3, 2021",Excellent adaptation of the board game & play is comparable to the Steam version (so far single player only). Only gripe is that the graphics get mighty tiny on my phone (Pixel 5) -- a workaround for this would be nice. Worth the $!
1956,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"September 29, 2021","When it works it's great. Unfortunately its buggy. Sometimes it will not allow me to change to a different action, sometimes it will not allow me to move forward at all. These issues tend to resolve if I exit the game and go back into it, but it is very frustrating."
1957,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"September 30, 2021",Beautiful and fun game! I am so happy it finally came out for mobile! This is possibly my favorite board game port. The gameplay is smooth. I did not run across any glitches or any other negative issues. I definitely recommend this game for anyone who loves board/strategy games.
1958,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"October 10, 2021","Excellent digital version of an awesome game. The tutorial is good for beginners. You can play Wingspan anywhere anytime on the train, on a lunch walk, or in bed!"
1959,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"October 20, 2021",Very well done....a bit fiddly at first but I got the hang of it without the tutorial (have played board game) within a handful of plays...
1960,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"September 30, 2021",AI could be a touch better and it would be nice if a seasonal background was always available but otherwise one of the best digital applications of a board game I have seen. The extra animations and customizations really make this pop.
1961,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"July 20, 2021","One of my favorite board games is in my pocket now? Amazing. Lovely digital rendition of Wingspan. If you like birds, or board games, or both, you'll love this. Very relaxing way to unwind."
1962,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"July 10, 2021","Keeps hanging when I take eggs, add eggs to birds. No forward progress arrow, game is essentially stuck. Was able to complete 1 game, last 2 have gotten stuck..."
1963,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"July 9, 2021","Oops, originally wrote a harsh review because I felt stuck in the game. I tried again and found the back button üòÇ Really soothing digital version of an awesome game!"
1964,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 27, 2021",Great app that perfectly simulates the board game. I greatly look forward to the expansions becoming available.

1966,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"February 23, 2021","Amazing board game with a beautiful digital implementation. Simple rules to learn, but with surprising depth."
1967,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 8, 2020",Love the board game and love the app. Both are beautiful and high quality.
1968,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 21, 2020",a bit buggy not vary smooth fun game though. i have the board game of this and it plays better
1969,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 20, 2020","Great quality but buggy on pixel 3, in multiple games had no way to proceed on decision, the icon to continue disappeared and made the game unplayable, refund requested"
1970,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"January 24, 2021",Fun. Needs the expansions though for its full potential. Edit: Notifications are broken. Will update my review when fixed.
1971,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 23, 2020","Despite the fact the game and interface is ok, the online playing is very buggy. I got disconnected many times, even though for me it was like the other players are pending their turns. And ofc, i lost a lot of Karma points for that...its a pity, the game is worth it though"
1972,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 5, 2020",EDIT: update has fixed the bug. Works well and plays beautifully now. Would like to see a tutorial on the automa though. Stuck at tutorial because the screen doesnt show the green arrow to confirm my actions. Refunded because I cant play it :(
1973,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 26, 2020","Love the game, but the online battle was a disgrace. the connection doesnt good enough for 5 mins plays. And i lose so many Karma (battle poins) because of the trash connection. pls fix it devs."
1974,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"April 5, 2021",Really solid adaptation. Great animatios and music add to the atmosphere. A few little crashes but expected for the initial launch. Can't wait for the expansions to be added
1975,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"January 1, 2021","Whatever problems earlier reviewers had, I haven't encountered. A friend's list would be very helpful. Can't wait for the Expansions!"
1976,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"April 12, 2021","I have this on steam and just got it on mobile. Lovely game, I plan to purchase the physical game as a Christmas present for my mother. I highly recommend this game."
1977,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"December 16, 2020",One of my favorite board games comes to the Google Play Store! That app is fantastic a must buy if you love board games.
1978,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 15, 2020",Fantastic digital board game. One of the few I own on multiple platforms.
1979,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"December 24, 2020",So many bugs and crashes
1980,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"April 9, 2021",Brilliant! Finally a peaceful and beautiful game.
1981,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 25, 2020","Amazingly fun game. Unfortunately, there are lots of bugs in this version, at least for me. Most notably, buttons and controls stop working in many situations, meaning I have to restart the game. Also, small objects often are impossible to move around"
1982,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 23, 2020",Great game you can make whatever you want as long as it is not copyright or inappropriate super fun game do recommend it but it is not as good as regular scribble notes
1983,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 9, 2020",It's okay put a free play option to just do anything you want with other people it would be better but it's a great game would recommend it would be awesome if it was free but it's pretty cheap compared to unlimited
1984,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"November 9, 2020",You can't move objects or if you do move them you better like that spot because it's not going anywhere. And you type out an object it's hard put it where you want to go in the first place.
1985,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"December 17, 2020",I couldn't even complete the tutorial because you cant move objects. If I could I would get a refund because this is a terrible game.
1986,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"December 18, 2020",Fun but I rated it 4 stars because soon you run out of stuff to create but very good idea to make a remix.
1987,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"May 8, 2021","Please get rid of the limit of the things that you can put in your place *EDIT* goodness... I was so dumb, I didn't realize the point of scribblenauts unlimited at the time."
1988,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"February 1, 2021","It's ok, just kind of feels like a budget scribblenauts game. The creation options are limited, there's no adjective editing, it just feels lacking in every way"
1989,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"April 17, 2021","This is a very solid and original game, nice graphics, good controls, and the game is extremely good at making you think outside the box. The only problem with me is the fact that everything doesn't come together when bought, but a solid game altogether."
1990,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"February 4, 2021","Great game, but it's a little glitchy. Every time I open it, after about ten or twenty minutes of playing the screen starts flashing and I have to close it and reopen it. Really sucks when you're almost finished with a level and have to redo it."
1991,Poly Bridge 2,4.7,$1.99 Buy,Simulation,"February 22, 2021","The puzzles can get a bit repetitive, there also way too easy at times. The game could definitely use a little work in the animation department but other than that its a great game. The reply value is almost limitless."
1992,ePSXe for Android,4.6,$3.75 Buy,Arcade,"December 18, 2021","It's a really good game! but it has a bug, when you write any adjective that changes the color of the object/person, it turns invisible. ""petrified zeus"" or ""red eel"" turn invisible and it's really hard to find said object to delete it"
1993,ePSXe for Android,4.6,$3.75 Buy,Arcade,"November 1, 2021",It's pretty fun I enjoy it but the controls are a little bit weird and different from other games but I enjoy it anyway because I haven't seen a scribblenaut game and forever and it's fun to start playing it again and I'm starting to get addicted
1994,ePSXe for Android,4.6,$3.75 Buy,Arcade,"December 1, 2021",Its a overall GOOD game but it needs improvement its a really funny game like you can spawn almost anthing you want but sometimes it lags and has glitches and it takes WAY to long to install it. So if you want the full package you should get the 4.99$ one.
1995,ePSXe for Android,4.6,$3.75 Buy,Arcade,"October 28, 2021",Fun game to excercise your imagination with puzzles! There's also a few playground levels where I like to build tiny scenes with funny characters with goofy animals. Seemingly ENDLESS possibilities! Absolutely amazing game!!!
1996,ePSXe for Android,4.6,$3.75 Buy,Arcade,"October 7, 2021","I love playground mode SOOO much! It's fun and the puzzles can challenge your mind..‚ò∫Ô∏è but.. it takes up a lot of mb! Whenever I delete stuff to re-install it, it makes the number higher!!! üò† Please fix that ‚òπÔ∏è"
1997,ePSXe for Android,4.6,$3.75 Buy,Arcade,"December 16, 2021",Its okay the graphics aren't bad but its more of a angry birds type of game you do levels and get no attack to three stars
1998,ePSXe for Android,4.6,$3.75 Buy,Arcade,"October 17, 2021","So..( if I was able to give a half Star I would have. )I only paid a buck for it and I want the buck back, the game won't load at all . I've had it for the entire day and have played it twice."
1999,ePSXe for Android,4.6,$3.75 Buy,Arcade,"September 23, 2021","So much fun and always has you using your mind to solve each level! This is one of those rate apos that should be within the top 5, if not Id love to see it at 1 or 2!"
2000,ePSXe for Android,4.6,$3.75 Buy,Arcade,"November 28, 2021","A lot of fun for what it is, there is a lot you can do with an alright sized play area and lots of nouns to add adjectives to, still a mobile app so dont expect the full game from console or pc."
2001,ePSXe for Android,4.6,$3.75 Buy,Arcade,"July 19, 2021",This story was beautiful and educated me on a topic I had no clue about. It had lots of lore and opportunities to put yourself in your child shoes. I highly recommend this game!
2002,ePSXe for Android,4.6,$3.75 Buy,Arcade,"July 16, 2021",Beautiful experience of a game. Had my heart aching the entire time and I wished the child was really my own. Absolutely wonderful story telling of something so horribly real. üíóüíî Thank you so much for the making of this game. üíóüíó
2003,ePSXe for Android,4.6,$3.75 Buy,Arcade,"November 7, 2021","Absolutely mind changing. This game made me feel like like Karen was my own child, I was absolutely heartbroken when she wouldn't allow me to touch her, feed her, or bath her. It really shows how sick people can be. This is the best 3 dollars I have ever spent on anything."
2004,ePSXe for Android,4.6,$3.75 Buy,Arcade,"October 24, 2021","The situations this child goes through are so painful to watch as the game progresses. It's so beautifully handcrafted too, from the graphics to the storytelling. Yes, it's sad at times but this game is a must play for adults. I do reccomend it."
2005,ePSXe for Android,4.6,$3.75 Buy,Arcade,"September 24, 2021","Such a great game, very well written and I like that the end is open to interpretation. I honestly got addicted and wanted to finish it in one sitting because the story line was fantastic."
2006,ePSXe for Android,4.6,$3.75 Buy,Arcade,"July 20, 2021","THIS WAS AMAZING! I'm so glad I bought the game! Honestly it made me cry quite a few times, which was wonderful. I really loved how it ended! It was heart wrecking but all the more happiness it made me feel!"
2007,ePSXe for Android,4.6,$3.75 Buy,Arcade,"September 1, 2021",Great game! Had me in tears. The story is extremely investing and kept me on for hours.
2008,ePSXe for Android,4.6,$3.75 Buy,Arcade,"November 3, 2021",The game shot me to tears when I saw what happened towards the end. I had something similar like that happened once and I have never felt more closer to the child. Thank you for the awareness. üíô

2208,Grand Theft Auto III,4.4,$4.99 Buy,Action,"May 20, 2020","It's playable again, mostly. Achievements still don't work. Stats don't work. The UI is still awful but at least it's playable."
2209,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"December 5, 2021",The game freezes sometimes. It tells you to take an action after you have taken both and will not let you go any further. You have to quit the game.
2210,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"December 8, 2021","Unable to connect to Google Play account. Once this is fixed, I'll happily re-purchase and review. The game design and controls are great."
2211,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"November 27, 2021",Neat game! Very poor online implementation. User interface is confusing. No usable description of past turns is available.
2212,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"December 23, 2021","I literally bought this game today, and haven't been able to complete one game due to ""network error"". Terrible first impression. I'll be requesting a refund."
2213,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"December 9, 2021","Cannot play online. The game cannot connect to Google Play and keeps giving me a ""Could not get authcode."" error even after updating Google Play Games and clearing the cache and data for it."
2214,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"December 7, 2021",Good implementation of the board game. Online multiplayer is smooth. Having a lot of fun with it!
2215,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"December 10, 2021",Please fix the online. You select an online game but doesn't let you choose how many to play against. Games against computer work fine
2216,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"November 30, 2021","Castles of Burgandy App crashes during play. Even the Refresh Button freezes up. Tags: Waste, Of, Money, Google, Play, Too Much Detail On Graphics, RAM, YouTube, Reddit, Facebook, Censorship, Communist, Unamerican"
2217,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"November 27, 2021","I mean I like it and all I'm a big star wars fan, but I don't think this is worth five stars. Because I have some errors like I log in after loading a saved file, and then the game crashes. But for Xbox it's a easy five star."
2218,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"November 29, 2021","Unplayable on Android 12. Works fine the first time you play. Any time you close and reopen the game it starts in portrait mode, zoomed into the screen. Tried changing orientation settings with no luck. The game refuses to even attempt to start if forced in landscape mode. Pixel 6 Pro on Android 12."
2219,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"December 4, 2021","Like so many others, Jolee disappears from the crew after the Livathan mission. I keep getting the I am broken, so very broken message. With Jolee missing, you can't get into the Temple of the ancients and you can't progress any further."
2220,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"December 23, 2021",Definitely one of the best starwars games to date. I enjoyed the graphics and game play for mobile I sadly didn't care for the story as much as I did the second kotor bc it made you be someone in the end regardless of who you tried to be or how you tried to as overall a very good game üëçüëèüòÄ
2221,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"November 21, 2021","I love this game, and the controls on the port can be annoying at times but honestly aren't that bad. I'd love to recommend it, but I cannot progress past the race. It always goes to an infinite black screen after I accept entry"
2222,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"December 4, 2021","Played till I had 13 plus hours on the game, made it to where iziz revolt and saved it. Lost all my progress did it twice now. I loved the game for I played this in my childhood after school but it's not worth the price if it keeps doing this. Good waste of time."
2223,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"December 15, 2021","Ever since Android 12, the game will switch to portrait mode and is cut off on the sides and is completely unplayable. Please please fix this!!!"
2224,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"December 19, 2021","So far the controls are OK, but a little buggy. The major issue is that I'm missing a lot of text dialog. It's not bad when they speak english, but I'm missing a lot of the alien dialog because it starts out without a text box. It's mostly on cutscenes"
2225,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"November 7, 2021",Aspyr media won't even let me play this game after I already purchased it on here... so now I'm having to wait for a refund through Google play services... don't waste your time and just get the remastered version on pc or ps5. This is bull***t.
2226,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"October 6, 2021",The dialogue is missing!! When you talk to aliens there aren't any subtitles so you have no idea what they're saying! Please fix this!! I'd love to play KOTOR as I did so many years ago on the original Xbox! Thanks!
2227,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"October 6, 2021","Love this game, grew up with it basically. Just a little frustrating when you can't see the subtitles to the opening conversation with the selected character. Awesome add with the Yavin space station, never got to experience that on the console."
2228,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"November 11, 2021",I get to swwop race on taris after prototype engine and it won't load race just gives me a black screen with sound I have done everything from deleting and reinstalling rebooting the game nothing changes it so why did I pay for this just to crash at the same spot on every new game I play!
2229,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"December 14, 2021","I loved it for the first 2 hours or so. Now whenever I try to start up the game it freezes on the loading screen. Before it was a few second load, now it doesn't move after 5 minutes."
2230,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"November 24, 2021","Rpg classic - was originally released in 2004 on PC and has been ported to phones. I played through the main story maybe a dozen times before, now I get to do it another dozen on my phone"
2231,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"November 26, 2021",It worked before Android 12 but just like others after updating to 12 it will load to a zoomed in portrait screen with most of it cropped out. Really disappointing.
2232,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"October 18, 2021",Soooooo I put in almost 6 hours just for me to get stuck in a part of the cantina where it crashes every time I try to leave. Fingers crossed this time around it works because this has been amazing otherwise üò©
2233,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"October 1, 2021","The game is very well adapted to mobile, I experienced no major issues. Although you have to realize that playing this game on a phone screen comes with some inherent limitations"
2234,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"December 5, 2021","Like others have been saying, the game crashes. I can't even start a park. The developers need to fix this ASAP or start issuing refunds to everyone. This is inexcusable for such a pricey premium game."
2235,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"October 10, 2021",I love this game I bought the computer version almost 2 years ago and then a few weeks ago I bought the android version... But now it's stuck on a screen that has a message saying it's checking for my purchase please fix this so I can play
2236,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"October 18, 2021",The port was great until the resolution issue popped up 2 YEARS ago and hasn't been fixed. Theres even been an update for something but not the resolution.
2237,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"December 22, 2021","As a 40 something RCT fan from the desktop days, I'll give this 5 stars on authenticity, nostalgia and for everything else that made this franchise legendary! I don't typically buy game apps, but this was a no-brainer and money well spent!"
2238,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"October 9, 2021",Haven't regretted a purchase at all I just wish there was a legitimate sandbox map. Just a flat open space and everything the sandbox provides it would be 10/10
2239,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"September 29, 2021",Great game just a little too complicated I couldn't even figure out how to build a coaster and actually have the people ride them instead of jumping on the sign then leaving but after a few days it was fine
2240,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"September 29, 2021",recently became unplayable. Some of the Parks crash upon loading. keeps crashing in the middle of the game also. refund please!
2241,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"October 13, 2021",This actually doesn't have a lot of reviews. (3k at the time and 100k downloads). I'm going to drop a 5 star for a decent port.
2242,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"December 12, 2021","Great game. They did a good job of bringing the game to cell phone. The controls take a little bit to get use to but once you get use to them(basically 1 level), it is almost as easy playing on the computer. I would not recommend unless you played rct on the computer a little tho."
2243,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"October 2, 2021","I don't have the steadiest of hands, but it's worth the frustration since I literally grew up with this game being one of my personal all time favs. Great port. UI could be a tad better but like I said, it's more my unsteady hands than a development issue. üíô"
2244,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"November 8, 2021","I used to play this game all the time on PC, it was my favorite. The app wouldn't even open for me on my S21 Ultra, just kept crashing. üòû I gave an extra star for the ease of the refund though, thanks for that. Hopefully this gets fixed and I can try again in the future."
2245,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"December 2, 2021","This review would be so much higher if I could so much as open app again. It's a fun game, but on the grounds where I paid money for this game and now it won't even open for 3 seconds without crashing. It's by definition unplayable. Please fix this. I really want to love this game."
2246,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"December 3, 2021",I just got this game. is a few issues off the bat.... one: it keeps freezing on me. two: why are all the parks free entry? I am so used to having a choise or even some free while others are not as a challenge. but all parks free just makes it down right difficult to accumulate money sometimes.
2247,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"November 16, 2021",I love love love love this game so much. It brings back so many good memories even though it's on a phone I feel it plays really well. I have not experienced a problem yet (and I hope I don't) if the devs ever were to release more DLC I would absolutely buy it. You guys getting A+ so far.
2248,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"November 23, 2021","Its a really dang good port. 6 bucks gets you 93 levels, and if you want all of the original content, the full game is 20 bucks, which is a bit expensive, but well worth it. I have porbably gotten around 100 hours of playtime off this game. Its great."
2249,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"November 30, 2021",Don't waste your money on this app. It crashes and support does not help. And they never update it to fix any problems.
2250,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"October 2, 2021","Absolutely LOVED this game as a kid. Having it on my phone is so rad, its pretty much exactly the same. I was hesitant to buy it because I was afraid it wouldn't be like the PC version but it's exactly the same. I've been hooked on it since I got it. Makes me feel like I'm 8 all over again hehe"
2251,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"October 7, 2021","9/7 UPDATE: Going on month 4 of ""we'll let you know."" Support is a joke. 6/8Purchased when the app came out years ago. Now wants me to repurchase. This is double charging. Game works great when it isnt trying to recharge you for everything."
2252,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"October 8, 2021","100% nostalgia !! Great game and is exactly like the original version. It is very pixelated but what do you expect when you pay for an old game LOL I have had no issues with it. I highly suggest to buy, it's a fun game to play from time to time."
2253,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"November 19, 2021","Great nostalgic fun that works surprisingly well using touch controls. UI is nice, though a couple things could use cleaning up, like entering names for things is a little ugly. No issues so far with performance or stability (Note 10+)"
2254,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"September 29, 2021","This game is awesome, I hope to see more of these older game releases on mobile. It's wonderful to have a game built around having fun instead of microtransactions. Honestly these old pc games are better than any current phone game you can find."
2255,Dead Cells,4.6,$8.99 Buy,Action,"September 29, 2021",Classic at its best. I love it!!!! Same just like on the original xbox. Though the open parks that you have why are all the park entrance free? Thats making it harder.
2256,Human: Fall Flat,3.6,$4.99 Buy,Puzzle,"November 26, 2021",Great port. Got sucked into this just as hard as I did when it was released back on PC. Got so used to the touch controls tried to fire up Open RCT2 on the PC thinking it'd be easier and it's a pita after getting used to this.
2257,Human: Fall Flat,3.6,$4.99 Buy,Puzzle,"December 14, 2021",Unplayable now unless you are zoomed all the way in. Would have previously given a 5 star as a perfect mobile port but the resolution is so extremely bad now that there is no definition when trying to view your park from any distance past the two closest zoom settings.
2258,Human: Fall Flat,3.6,$4.99 Buy,Puzzle,"October 30, 2021",Well... What can I say? It's a classic. Good fun. From time to time the controls are a tad frustrating.
2259,Human: Fall Flat,3.6,$4.99 Buy,Puzzle,"December 14, 2021","yes, the game is a little pixelated. but. the game is hella old, so i cant expect 720p or higher, still an awsome game, brings back so many memories.. absoultely love it!!"
2260,Human: Fall Flat,3.6,$4.99 Buy,Puzzle,"December 12, 2021",Idk how atari could screw up such an easy classic.. spent $40 at least on this and it still needs multiple patches and quality of life fixes.. NOT updates we're forced to buy all over again either. Cmon atari just update this game!!!
